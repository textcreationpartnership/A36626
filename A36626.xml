            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Had no sooner finished my defence against M. <hi>Wills</hi>'s his first and furious assault; but was summoned to a fresh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter by the daring challenge of my old fellow-Soldier Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> and whom I presume so to own, because he now seems so contemptuously and ignominiously to treat persons under that character, as though he had quite forgot that he himself had so long acted that part in the Army, and been by word and deed so active in that cause, none more in his capacity in the <hi>3</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons if we may believe himself; having n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inst all its opposites; but by zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously engaging and bringing in so many others also into it, as his own words hath it: <hi>Encouraged thousands to it, and thought when he was ingaged in it he never did God that outward service as then.</hi> And was not this a hearty souldier, and <hi>Hero</hi> indeed? It is true it may be he will now tell you that he has recanted these things, and as lately in his Preface to his <hi>Cath. Thol. That at heart he little regarded that Interest, especially as to the civil part of it:</hi> (And is not that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful strange? What pray, and preach so many <hi>1000</hi> into it? write, covenant, fight, and engage at that rate for it, and avow that he never did God th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t outward service as then, and yet no heart to it or for it; if this be not desperate Hypocrisy or Prevarication I know nothing:) But as to those repentings, Mr <hi>Bagshaw</hi> has told us from himself how we are to esteem them: repeating that most remarkable passage that Mr <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> has given us long since about them, <hi>viz. That should the change of times make him forget that state that we were fully in, and change his judgment, by loosing the sence of what then conduced to its infortion</hi> (which it seems to
<pb facs="tcp:41496:2"/> appearance it hath fully done, bespeaking him a great Prophet, to foretell how it would befall him under such like circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) <hi>this folly and forgetfulness</hi> (sayth he) [for so it seems we are to interpret such Tergiversations] <hi>would be the way to a sinful and not obedient Repentance,</hi> therefore it seems all such repentings and turnings with the time must go for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yea worse then nothing, even sinful and disobedient.</p>
            <p>Which things are mentioned for his better remembrance, not doubting but upon the calling to minde some such passages he may (at least others I doubt not will) conceive, that one that has acted at such a rate, and falls so justly under such censure himself, ought to carry it to others with more sobriety and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and with less censure and reflection then he usually doth; and that scornful and contemptuous ill language will neither become souldier, Christian or Minister, much less one that professeth more then any to invite, yea, to conjure all men to love, peace, union, and moderation.</p>
            <p>But the matter under consideration before you, is, how the contemned souldier has acquit himself in the contest with this man of might: and which you will best understand by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his charge, and the defence he makes thereto.</p>
            <p>You may remember therefore, that the charge is of <hi>2</hi> parts: First, for <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Prevarication</hi> in abusing Antiquity, relating especially to <hi>4.</hi> sorts of people, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Donatists,</hi> Old <hi>Britans, Waldenses,</hi> and <hi>Wickliff:</hi> All which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly examined, orderly and fully replyd to, and freed from the pretended Forgery and Prevarication, no sueh thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be proved; and except the oversight of misnaming an Author quoted from <hi>Fuller,</hi> though the words truly recited, <hi>viz. Chocleus</hi> for <hi>Walden,</hi> and mentioning <hi>Austins</hi> 3d. and 4th. Book against the Donatists for the 4th Book only: And the mistake about <hi>Lanifrank</hi> to prove <hi>Beringarius</hi> denyed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism, though fully made good by <hi>2</hi> more, <hi>viz. Guit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41496:3"/> &amp; <hi>Durandus,</hi> not another that I know of in the whole, whereas diverse palpable gross mistakes are apparently made good against him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for in justice done him by changing several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions and calumnies upon his writings, which he denies, challenging proof to be made thereof, and which you have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and fully done, Proving by clear, and ample demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that he has been for and against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> for and against <hi>Arminianism;</hi> for and against <hi>Anabaptism;</hi> for and against <hi>Tradition,</hi> for and against <hi>Popery;</hi> the last (<hi>viz.</hi> his being for <hi>Popery</hi>) to be lamented above all: the other but naturally leading to it. As Dr. <hi>Peirce</hi> tells him, p. <hi>171.</hi> of his <hi>Appendix: you have</hi> (saith he) <hi>vilified the Protestants of every sort, Episcopacy, Presbytery, Independancy, Erastanisme, and so make men run into Popery by way of Refuge, and if you fright them from them, you leave them to be nothing but Jews, and Heathens, and I would fain know</hi> (saith he) <hi>what sort of Christians in the world you have not endeavoured to disgrace at one time or another</hi> (professing he knows none.) <hi>And as to that of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> (tells him) <hi>that Mr</hi> Crandon [<hi>viz.</hi> a late Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Minister who wrote that large book against him] <hi>had told the world he were a Papist, and one of the worst sort of Papists too, and what the particular Books were that had made him a Papist, and what Emissares he had in all parts of the Land:</hi> Which with a friendly Admonition is left to his Conscience and the judicious Reader, with this twofold Lamentation.</p>
            <p>First, that a man of those parts and endowments that might be so serviceable to the Church of Christ, should prove so great a troubler and disturber thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that notwithstanding his daring and renew'd op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position day by day, not only against the whole Nonconforming
<pb facs="tcp:41496:3"/> party, but the Protestant Doctrine and interest it self, that no more hath come forth against him to defend the truth; and that whilst one little <hi>Sherlock,</hi> is met with by so many Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronian Champions, there is yet but one <hi>Tully</hi> come forth to encounter this great <hi>Baxter</hi> in his voluminous defiance against the truth; and therefore wonder not if the stones in the street should rise up as witnesses, and babes and sucklings, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible soldiers should have their Mouths opened in such a cause, against such an enemy and avenger.</p>
            <p>That truth may prevail, righteousness, love, and peace kiss each other, and all errour and iniquity stop its mouth, is the sincere desire, and shall ever I trust be the hearty endeavour of him, that designes nothing more then to approve himself an affectionate servant to truth and all the friends thereof whilst</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Shews, that <hi>Mr Baxter</hi> hath so far owned the book he so scornfully writes against, that of the <hi>14.</hi> chapters it contains he has justifyed <hi>12</hi> if not <hi>13.</hi> of them.</head>
               <p>DR. <hi>Pierce</hi> in his New discoverer tels us, that M. <hi>Baxter</hi> (from his writings which he quotes) <hi>having confest himself to be guilty of pride and prejudice</hi> p. 92. And <hi>also that a spirit of keeness (or calumny as the Dr sayth) dwelt in him, p.</hi> 258. wonders not therefore his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings should abound with so much bitterness to friend and foe with whom he contended, <hi>resolving therefore as in his preface not to render him evil for evil, nor to vie slanders with such a man of tongue, for that as he saith would be but to strive who should be most impious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it being as it seems so much the temper of the man, his mode of treating me in that way of <hi>rhetorical rayling</hi> and <hi>contemptuous reviling</hi> is no other then the usual <hi>measure</hi> he hath meeted out to his <hi>Antagonists,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the less to be <hi>regarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41496:6"/>
               <p>But inasmuch as he hath <hi>proclaymed my book</hi> to contain such a <hi>noysom Fardel,</hi> and to be writ with so much <hi>temerity,</hi> and <hi>falshood,</hi> that a sober <hi>Turk,</hi> and modest <hi>Pagan</hi> might blush to own it.</p>
               <p>I have therefore in the first place thought it meet in order to my <hi>just vindication,</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, and to tell the world that that very book he so nauseously contemns, he has him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in words at length, and by good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, substantially owned and justifyed, not only in the witnes it bears for <hi>believers,</hi> but against <hi>infants Baptism</hi> also, which takes in the whole of the book in all its parts: and to the better discovery thereof I shall first represent you with a <hi>brief scheme</hi> of the <hi>book,</hi> and then particularly shew you, that what he hath not <hi>grosly abused</hi> and falsly fathered upon me in the 14. <hi>chapter</hi> he hath sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tantially owned in the other chapters.</p>
               <p>That book then you must know consists of 2 <hi>parts,</hi> the first proving the <hi>Baptism of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> only in 7. Chapters, the second dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that of <hi>infants Baptism</hi> in 7. more, of which 14. Chapters, 11. of them are <hi>doctrinal viz.</hi> deducing and proving each particular from the <hi>scripture,</hi> upon which the <hi>main stress</hi> is layd; the other 3. Chapters are <hi>historical,</hi> demonstrating from <hi>antiquity,</hi> and <hi>humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> the truth of believers, and error of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptism;</hi> and which <hi>historical</hi> part (as I have said again and again) is not urged for <hi>probation</hi> but <hi>illustration</hi> only; and that because
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41496:6"/>
                  <hi>antiquity</hi> hath been so much <hi>boasted</hi> of; it may appear we have something to say for our selves rherein also.</p>
               <p>Now that Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> hath of these 14. <hi>chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> by words at length, and good arguments subscribed to 12. if not 13. of them is my next work to make manifest, wherein you'l finde the brief contents of each of these 13 chapters, and the owning he gives thereto, annexed to each, and which I beg the readers patience to do, with the arguments more at large from himself then I have yet done, and that for the following reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because yet they stand as remark't by us for unanswered arguments from his own pen in full confirmation of ours, in posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive contradiction to his own writings, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the provocations he has had from Mr <hi>Tombs,</hi> and my self to reconcile the same, if he can; and being so agreeable to his usual, method of writing, having as Dr. <hi>Peirce</hi> often told him [and made good] in the said book, writ for and against popery, for and against Episcopacy, for and against Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for and against Independency, for and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Erastanisme, and this abundantly makes good how he has writ for and against Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it may be seen, and read of all, that much of his barbarous and inhumane dealing with me, is but for saying the same things that himself hath said before in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this controversie; and which I desire
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41496:7"/> may stand as a monument upon record, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and me, as a full vindication from his own pen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that with the substance of my book in this Epitomy thus repeated, Mr. <hi>B's</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial arguments and full Scripture-autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities confirming the same may be reveiwed also, which may be of use to some of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers who may be induced to read and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he says to the point, when they will slight the same things spoken by others.</p>
               <p>And as to the 14th Chapter how notoriously he has abused me, himself, and the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, you will have the account in the 2d. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>This saith he speaking of this Text is not like some occasional historical mention of Baptism; but it is the very commission it self of Christ to his Disciples, for preaching and baptizing, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely expresseth their several works in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places and orders.</p>
                  <p>The first task is to make disciples which are by <hi>Mark</hi> called beleivers.</p>
                  <p>The second work is, to baptize them, whereto is annexed the promise of their salvation.</p>
                  <p>The third work is, to teach them all other things which are after to be learned in the School of Christ.</p>
                  <p>To contemn this order is to renounce all rules of order, for where can we expect to finde it, if not here, I profess my conscience is fully satisfied from this text, that it is one sort of faith even sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that must go before baptism, and the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion whereof the Minister must expect; <hi>but is it possible that an ignorant babe can observe this order and answer this expectation;</hi> of which see what is to this purpose cited by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Pisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:</hi> viz. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon <hi>Mat. 3.6. saith,</hi> Therefore that men may rightly offer themselves to baptism, confession of sin, is required, otherwise the whole action is nothing else but sport. <hi>Piscator,</hi> upon <hi>Mark: 1.4.</hi> saith, it is called the Baptism of repentance for remission of sins because <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41496:8"/> preached the remission of sins to the penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein by his strong objections he makes in the case, and his weak answers thereto, he hath wholly given it up, as I have made appear in the Treatise <hi>p.</hi> 217. to which he hath made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and therefore till he do he must not think it much, that we conclude, that he takes it for granted that the Baptism so given is a perfect nullity.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see how fully in words at length, and by substantial Argument, he hath justifyed what I have affirmed from Scripture &amp; antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in these 12 or 13. Chapters: both as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving believers the only subjects of Baptism, as the disproving of infants, as well in the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as historical part, so that he cannot smite me for the same but he must wound himself.</p>
                     <p>For 1st, as to the doctrinal or scriptural part have I proved believers the only proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptism, from the order of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, the Apostles teaching, the primitive saints practise, the new testament dispensation, the constitution of the primitive Church; and hath not he done the same most amply fully and substantially?</p>
                     <p>And 2ly. Have I disproved the baptizing of infants from the silence of the Scripture, fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41496:16"/> traditions, mistaken grounds and scripture; change of the rite, mischiefs and absurdityes, nullity, and insignificancy of such a practise, and hath not he by words at length, and good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence done the fame?</p>
                     <p>And 2ly, as to the historical part, have I, 1st; from antiquity made good, that profession of faith was in the first ages required before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism: and that the children of Christians were not baptized till aged: and hath not he fully done the same by ample testimony from antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. Have I proved that baptizing of infants was not as a Church ordinance judged necessary for the first 300. years; and hath not he fully done the same?</p>
                     <p>Therefore for him to render me odious for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the same things he himself hath so fully maintained, is just such dealing as Dr <hi>Peirce</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves he meeted out to <hi>Grotius,</hi> as blackening and contemning him for being a Papist, when he himself in his writings appears to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (as the Dr saith) in his pre-advertisment to his <hi>New discoverer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>'Tis true I prove him to be a papist by</hi> 4. <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but they are arguments only</hi> ad hominem, <hi>and professedly urged by a</hi> prosopopaeia, <hi>and only in order to his conviction, that more may be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, then he can say against</hi> Grotius, <hi>and that his injuries to</hi> Grotius <hi>do only prove his own hurts: and having thus proved him to be a papist, I freely profess to believe him none.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So we may say his words and arguments
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41496:17"/> prove him an Anabaptist, he justifying them by these Arguments both in their principles and practise, for which nevertheless he persecutes and reproaches us, which proves him none; So unhappy has he been in his polemical writings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But I know it will be said that these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken out of his 2d. <hi>disput.</hi> Dr <hi>Tombes</hi> and I have injuriouslly represented and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against him, contrary to his declared sense and intention, for when he speaks of profession necessary before Baptism he means only in adult persons and not otherwise in Infants, then as the believing parents make the profession for them in their name and stead.</p>
                     <p>Answ. <q rend="inline">To which it hath again and again been told him that he hath no injury done him (no more then Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> did the Romanist, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Papists contradictions for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant cause) by so improving his own words and arguments so substantially brought from the Scripture for believers against his slight sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions and unproved dictates for Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; for though it is true he might mean (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tells him) to beat down Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> tenent of baptizing upon a dogmatical faith, yet the middle terms and proofs beats down his own tenet of Infants-Baptism, and directs into the right way of restoring believers Baptism, and so his Arguments prove not only against Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> for a profession of a justifying faith to every one that is to be baptized, but that that profession, be personal also, as his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fully evince, and which therefore fully
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41496:17"/> prove against himself in that his imputative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or others professing for the baptized.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For instance take 2. or 3. of his Arguments, as first, from the order of Christs commission: <hi>If to baptize after the profession faith or being made believers</hi> (as he explains it from <hi>Mark</hi> 16.) <hi>is the order that Christ has appointed, then we must baptize such and no other, but so has Christ appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his commission; therefore must the minister expect such a profession in every one he baptizeth, otherwise he inverts the order of Christs Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth the thing that is ridiculous, yea impious and prophane,</hi> and what anabaptist can say more?</p>
                     <p>But is not the Baptizing of an Infant from whom the Minister can expect no profession, a contradicting the commission? an inverting the order of Christ therein, that requiring a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession before, and this device of Mr <hi>B.</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it after.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. From the Apostles doctrine an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of such they baptized, see how he reasons: <hi>If neither precept or example in Scripture be for the baptizing any but upon the profession of faith and repentance, then we must not baptize any without it, but</hi> (saith he) <hi>we have neither precept or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the baptizing of any other; the precept he proves from</hi> John, <hi>Christ, and the Apostles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the example he gives for the same throughout the new testament, whereof he produceth</hi> 11. <hi>famous instances, witnessing that none were baptized but upon their personal profession of faith and repentance, and therefore concludes we must baptize none without it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41496:18"/>
                     <p>Which therefore not only destroys Mr <hi>Blakes</hi> notion of baptizing the child upon the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a wicked man for it; but Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> also upon the profession of a godly man for it: because personal profession was required in every one that was baptized in Scripture, and therefore to baptize any without personal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, which no child is capable to give, is by his own Argument so without book, that there is no one precept or example for it in all the new Testament.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, from the ends of Baptism, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he most substantially argues after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as you see, <hi>viz. If Christ hath instituted no Baptism but to such who testify a present rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration wrought in them, whereof Baptism is to be a sign; and to none but to such as are capable to enter into Covenant with God, by a marriage uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ</hi> (which that action lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> solemnizeth) <hi>and to none but such as are capable to answer a good Conscience, which is required of every one therein,</hi> &amp;c. then we must baptize such, and none other, and which by sound Scripture Argument he undenyably proves, and that whoever baptizeth other it is none of Christs institution; whether it is not therefore as manifest that an Infant that is so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly uncapable to perform any of these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ends is not as wholy excluded, though a profession is made for him of a justifying faith by a godly parent: as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell) excludes Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Infant that has on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the profession of a dogmatical faith by an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41496:18"/> ungodly Parent for it? and so we might go on with the rest against his Arguments; but let these suffice.</p>
                     <p>And notwithstanding Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly urged him to reconcile these seeming contradictions, or to renounce his book of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism</hi> in his <hi>felo de se</hi> writ about 16. years since, and since about 3. years earnestly pres't him thereto by letter also, besides my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Arguments that from time to time I have urged upon him to do the truth and eimself right therein; and since by another hand else that has printed some of Mr. <hi>B's</hi> arguments for believers baptism: and therefore by all hands it has been expected from him.</p>
                     <p>Yet what at last has been brought forth but some of his old unproved dictates which he would impose upon us as a reconciliation to the contradictions aforesaid:<note place="margin">Mr <hi>B's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant Answer.</note> for all that he saith for himself therein, you'l finde in his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus I have gone through 13. of my 14. Chapters, and made them good, I doubt not from Mr. <hi>B's</hi> own words, and that being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the controversy betwixt him and me is undoubtedly ended, being so fully given up in both parts of it, both as to Scriptures and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: For though the 14th. Chapter doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend particular witnesses against Infants-Baptism, yet those testimonyes that are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> out of antiquity, to prove on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for adult Baptism in the first ages, and that Infants-Baptism was not judged necessary, are substantial witnesses against it, should no more have been produced, and that I had been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in those that I mention in the 14th Chapter.</p>
                     <p>But I doubt not therein also to acquit my self, and to make good that, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of my book, and thereby discover Mr. <hi>B's.</hi> most injurious and unrighteous dealing with me, and the truth, to his just rebuke and shame of face.</p>

                        <hi>Tertullians</hi> witness justifyed.</note> my first witness; to justifie whose denyall of Infants Baptism as an ordinance of Christ I have produced a 7-fold Argument, and the concurring Testimony of diverse learned men, <hi>viz. Illiricus</hi> and his companions, <hi>Beatus Rhenanus, Scultetus, Daille,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> who concluded, that he denyed Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism as unwarrantable and Irrationall.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in substance saith these two things, first, <hi>that it appears by</hi> Tertullians <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it, that it was</hi> de facto <hi>in use, and that some did practise it in that century, thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting my self, in affirming that it doth not appear to have been practised, till the following century; and demands why that has not been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered?</hi> Secondly, <hi>that what</hi> Tertullian <hi>spoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matter, it was only in point of conveniency, about deferring of Baptism in Children and others also, but concludes not against baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, being himself for it, in case of danger of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41496:22"/>
                  <p>To both which in my answer to Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> I have largely spoke, though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to overlook it, and not at all to regard what I have said.</p>
                  <p>Having as to the first affirmed with Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> that the notion of the thing as urged from divine authority, came into the world before the practise of it; the arguments about which are thus early (in its first appearance) and most substantially refuted by this great Doctor <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian;</hi> not only as to the mistaken, Scripture then and ever since pretended for it, <hi>viz. suffer little children to come to me,</hi> &amp;c. but also the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in capacity of Children, or any but grown persons, to perform that great ordinance aright; the folly of Witnesses so unwarrantably to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for children, the great <hi>Basis</hi> upon which afterwards it was built, the danger of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an ordinance of Christ, the insignificancy of the ends pretended to take away sin; which was a witness with a witness, striking at the root and foundation of all the pretentions to it, as more at large is there shewed.</p>
                  <p>And as to <hi>Tertullian's</hi> being nevertheless for it, it is an utter mistake, as I have demonstrated, who was only, upon the superstitious conceit then it seems fancyed: for the baptizing of dying persons, as some were in after times when <hi>Austin</hi> caused his dying distracted friend to be baptized, <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 89. <hi>Amicus quidam Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus etiam nescius baptizatur: Protogenes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so caused sick children, to be baptized for their health, as before. But what is this to the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41496:22"/> of children, as an ordinance of Christ, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them into the Church, and the priviledges thereof, the thing pretended to and pleaded for?</p>
                  <p>And therefore, Is not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> worthy of blame to pretend to answer books, and take no more regard to what is said by his opposite? which when he or any body else replys to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting what hath been said to this witness, they may expect an Answer; but in the mean time let what hath been said suffice.</p>

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41496:23"/>
                  <p>But to the matter of my own reproach: in the first place, to put Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> out of doubt, he must know, that before I put down these Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of <hi>Austin,</hi> I did read them, and have yet so much Latine left after 30. years dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance from the University, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand (as I conceive) what I read therein, and therefore I shall put it to the tryall whether I be such a falsifyer as is not to be matched in the world: And if the great <hi>Jansenius</hi> who read <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi> works 30. times over, did so mistake him, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his late <hi>Catholick Theology</hi> tells us, it may not be so wondred at, if I should mistake him also.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Austin</hi> did in his book of Baptism a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Donatists</hi> write diverse Arguments for Infants Baptism, from supposed Antiquity before; universal consent, (as he says) of the Church then, as well as by Arguments from the Scriptures, particularly from the Analogy that Baptism might have with circumcision, to save the Infants: and from <hi>John.</hi> 3.5. o be baptized or born of water for salvation, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot deny, and therefore I shall not need to produce the words; but upon what grounds he denies it to be properly urged, we shall discourse afterwards.</p>
                  <p>And that I read also what <hi>Austin</hi> wrote to <hi>Vincentius Victor,</hi> in the quotation mentioned. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de anima Ch.</hi> 13.14. concerning his deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants Baptism (as the denying of Infants Baptism went in those days) <hi>viz.</hi> that Children might be saved without it, though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41496:24"/> saith, <hi>there is not a word of truth in it; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no such matter in that Chapter or the whole book:</hi> le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the following words of <hi>Austin</hi> vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate me <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 1284. <hi>Tu autem, &amp; originalis peccati reos parvulos confiteri, &amp; tamen eos sine la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacro Regenerationis absolvis &amp; in paradisum mittis, &amp; postea etiam Regnum coelorum intrare: But thou who acknowledges that Children are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Original sin (which it seems the</hi> Donatists <hi>did) yet without Baptism absolves them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to go into paradise, and afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of Heaven: Haec multum aperteque perversa &amp; fidei catholicae adversa,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which manifestly appears to be perverse and against the Catholick faith:</hi> And therefore in another place tells him that he thereby did eontemn what is said, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>He that is not born of water and the spirit shall not enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> writing also his whole book to <hi>Renatus</hi> against him for this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is that <hi>Walden</hi> in so many places (who charges <hi>Wickliff</hi> with the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) doth so accuse him by several quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of <hi>Austin,</hi> and particulary <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 101. <hi>fol.</hi> 104. <hi>Audax</hi> Vincentius <hi>concedit parvulos trahere primaevum delictum; sed, si non Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentaliter Baptizantur, intraturos in regnum Coelorum</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Audacious</hi> Vincent, <hi>acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that Infants are guilty of Original sin, but, though not Sacramentally baptized, to enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Whom he Judges and condemns for the same 20. times in the said Book.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:41496:24"/>
                  <p>And therefore it is, that <hi>Vicecomes</hi> in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of those that denyed Infants Baptism <hi>[Baptismum parvulorum qui negarunt,]</hi> ranks <hi>Vincentius victor</hi> the <hi>Donatist, apud St. August.

                  <p>And that his brethren the Donatists were one with him herein, Dr <hi>Fredrick Spanhaemius,</hi> no friend (as is well known) to the Anabaptists, doth in his book which in English is intituled, <hi>Englands Warning, ch.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 48. speaking of the erroneous opinions of the Anabaptists, sayth, <hi>That with the Donatists, Eunomians, and other Hereticks they do condemn childrens Baptism.

                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the concurring Testimony of so many other Authors, viz. <hi>Bullenger, Fuller, Twisk, Franke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Therefore you see I am neither so gross a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor so notorious a falsifyer, as Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> would render me, having faithfully given you my Authorities for the same; <hi>valeant quantum valere possunt,</hi> Let them signify what they will:</p>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But 'tis urged as the grand objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this, <hi>That suppose the Donatists did with Vincentius Victor affirm, that Infants that were not sacramentally baptized might be saved, what is that to their denying Infants Baptism, the thing affirmed from it? For who almost amongst the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants that own Infants Baptism, but do affirm
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41496:25"/> the same thing? must it therefore be fathered upon them that they deny it also?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> It is true, that many of our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants may and do affirm now, that children may be saved who die unbaptized, and yet not be denyers, but may be, and are, owners and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctisers of Infants Baptism: but this is no reason that they who so affirmed formerly, might and did so also: Because Infants Baptism was held then upon clear other grounds, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends than now.</p>

                  <p>But you'l say, When was it that these old Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were given up of baptizing children for their salvation, to take away original sin, to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate them, and to make them members of Christ, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the deed done?

                  <p>To which I say, I have already given you some account in the Treat. of Baptism p. 159. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:41496:28"/> That the first writer of note that gives us any of these new Arguments, as Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> that great searcher into this controversy informs us, was <hi>Zwinglius</hi> about 120. years since; and that he went a new way, his own words in the beginning of his book of Baptism imports, which are these, <hi>viz.

                  <p>And that this is the new way appeareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Papists as it is well known kept <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi> way all along, and so continue to do to this very day, and to that degree that they (as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> and those Councils served the <hi>Donatists</hi>) have served those that go this new way, who deny Infants to be baptized for salvation.</p>

Fox,</hi> Martyr vol. 1. p. 867. 868. And further <hi>Walden</hi> tells us that the <hi>Wickliffists</hi> did <hi>in his day reason with them, that, if Children might be baptized by the faith of others, they might also be saved by the faith of others; and therefore it was needless to baptize them for Salvation.</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> And that the <hi>Novatians</hi> were the same with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> I no ways doubt, from the reasons before expressed, and to which I shall add what I meet with in <hi>Gabriel Prateolus, de vit. sect.</hi> concerning the <hi>Novatians,</hi> p. 123. viz. <hi>That they affirmed, that Infants did not stand in need of Baptism, Infantes non egere Baptismo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the clearing of which, I have been the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not only to make this point of the <hi>Donatists</hi> more manifest, but, more fully to evidence, what we have to say, respecting our other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in this particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But Mr <hi>B.</hi> tells us, that <hi>Austins</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his <hi>Book against the</hi> Donatists <hi>for Infants Baptism, mentioned by me, are rather so many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments they held it, than that they denyed it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he therein urgeth Arguments from the tenet of the Ʋniversal Church, &amp; every Christian for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I say: that, if this be Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> chiefest ground (as indeed it is) why he concludes me such a notorious falsifyer, I appeal to the judicious Reader, whether it be not very hard measure to be so severely dealt with, upon no better demonstration than upon his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle apprehension, and no better proved; and I
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41496:30"/> appeal to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whether, if I should deal so with him, I should not render my self both immodest and unchristian therein.</p>
                  <p>But to his proof: <hi>I am the most notorious falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier in the world.</hi> Because I affirm <hi>Austin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against the <hi>Donatists,</hi> for denying Infants Baptism in those Arguments in the 4th. Book. 24 Chapter. whereas therein (as he saith) <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin affirms the quite contrary,</hi> viz. <hi>that the</hi> Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists <hi>did own it, and the reason is, because he affirms, that none of the universal Church disowned it then or at any other time, nor that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian disowned it. But the Donatists he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to be of the universal Church, and Christians also, therefore this serves only to prove that they did not deny it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is either true or false what <hi>Austin</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that all the universal Church, then, and before also, did own Infants Baptism, and that he also owned the Donatists to be members of the Church, and Christians also: if not, that Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> argues weakly, and his undue reflections return upon himself.</p>
                  <p>To the first, that some of the universal Church in the ages before <hi>Austin,</hi> did disown, and not practise Infants-Baptism, is evident from undeniable Authority. Was not <hi>Tertullian</hi> of the universal Church or a Christian, who judged it so unwarrantable and irrational as Dr <hi>Barlow</hi> tells us? and all those in the 2d, and 3d, and 4th. Age that baptized only the adult, neither of the universal Church nor Christians? then, What will Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> say to his own assertion before
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41496:30"/> mentioned? where he tells us, that <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who lived in the. 2d. and 3d. <hi>Cent. do all of them affirm, that in the primitive times, none were baptized without an express Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherein they renounced the world, flesh, and devil; and engaged themselves to Christ and profest to obey him;</hi> and, if there were no other but sueh, surely some in those dayes must deny Infants Baptism; confirmed also by so many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorityes given in the <hi>Treat.</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> from p. 55. to. p. 65. and p. 102. And, What will Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> say to that other assertion that he gives us, viz. <hi>That Christians had liberty in those first ages to let their Children stay till age before they baptized them? And that</hi> Austin <hi>himself and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children of Christian Parents were baptized at age?</hi> And was that because they owned or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned their baptizing in Infancy? <hi>He knows who had need of a good memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were the Parents of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> though his father a Bishop at his birth, and <hi>Basil</hi> also, neither members of the universal Church, nor Christians, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> We might mention divers others, but let these suffice to prove <hi>Austin</hi> rash, and Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> forgetfull; to say no more.</p>
                  <p>And that some Christians did not own it in <hi>Austins</hi> dayes, is very clear: otherwise; what means all his Arguments he writes in 20. of his books to prove it? and that book he particularly writes upon that poynt, <hi>de Baptismo Parvulorum,</hi> and the great heat and rigour he useth therein? And all the decrees of Councels for it, and many of them procured by his means; were they only
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41496:31"/> to convince heathens? Mr <hi>Marshal</hi> in his sermon tells us p. 5. that some in those times did questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Infants Baptism, as <hi>Austin</hi> grants in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>de verbis Apostolorum. But,</hi> were none of <hi>those, Christians or members of the Church?</hi> It may be, in <hi>Austin's</hi> account they were not; because his censures are so heavy, that <hi>they should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, Anathematized, and shun'd as the Plague,</hi> as you have heard.</p>
                  <p>But, saith Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> he own'd the Donatists to be members of the Church, and Christians: And own'd their Baptism to be valid. It is true in many places he seemeth so to speak.</p>
                  <p>But, what he truly thought of their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Christianity and Baptism you'l better judg, when you hear him speak.</p>
                  <p>First to their Church state: it was so good that as Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> grants. p. 245. <hi>Austin</hi> questioned <hi>whether salvation was among them;</hi> and by his Ep. to <hi>Bonif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And how well he approved of their Baptism he expresseth in his book, <hi>de Baptismo cont. Don. Quod sit autem perniciosius, utram omnino non Baptizari aut Rebaptizari, judicare difficile est. Which is most pernicious, either not at all to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, or to Rebaptize, is very hard to judge:</hi> so that their Baptism was as good as no Baptism, and which, in his own account, rendred them next to heathens: and <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 91. <hi>Baptismus apud

                  <p>So that, <hi>Austin's</hi> thus reasoning with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> those Anabaptists then, doth no more prove them approvers of Infants Baptism, than, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> should use the same words with the Anabaptists now (whom, he saith, he owns to be members of the Universal Church, and good Christians too, which is more than <hi>Austin</hi> did) will prove, in another age, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did thereby demonstrate they own'd Infants Baptism; though only guilty, with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> of rebaptization and sinfull sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Another of his Arguments why the <hi>Donatists</hi> were not against Infants Baptism is; <hi>Because, he saith, they were for Episcopacy; and had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned-Bishops amongst them, pag.</hi> 243.251. But, what is that to the purpose? are not the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists for Episcopacy? and have not they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained-Bishops, or Elders, amongst them now? But, it is true they have no Lord-Bishops, nor Diocesan-Bishops amongst them: And no more, had they then that I can finde.</p>
                  <p>And then, after all, concludes with a scoffing Jeer, as though his former Injuries had not been
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41496:32"/> enough, p. 252. <hi>viz.</hi> And now if <hi>John Becold will say, they were of his side, we must believe him.</hi> But how well such Sareasms become one that would be thought so mortifyed and grave a Divine; and who is, as he tells us, in the constant sense of his being upon the brink of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and who hath with no better Arguments opposed his Antagonist; is recommended to the Judgment of the unbiased Reader. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is a testimony that I lay the least stress upon; but, from the probability thereof, through the many concurring circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, attending it, have brought it in, amongst so many other witnesses that speak so fully, and positively to the point: yet,</p>

                  <p n="1">1st, <hi>Give you a brief account what I have said in my treatise about it:</hi>

                  <p n="2">2dly, <hi>The substance of Mr</hi> Wills <hi>his Objections, and my answer.</hi>

                     <hi>First,</hi> That, amongst the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> there were Christians that denyed Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; I first gave my grounds, and after vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the same from Mr <hi>Wills</hi> cavills: which was, briefly, thus;</p>

                        </hi> Question to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as <hi>Fabian</hi> from <hi>Bede</hi> reports.</note> in Mr <hi>Fox</hi> those three Demands which <hi>Austin</hi> made to the <hi>Britains, about Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Easter, Baptism, and Preaching, after the manner, usage and custom of Rome;</hi> I took notice (among other authors he quoted to make good the same) what <hi>Robert Fabian</hi> said about it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of our English Historians, who wrote in <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. or <hi>Hen.</hi> the Seventh's time; who tells us the story expresly, as I have mentioned (i. e.) pag 227.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41496:33"/>
                  <p>And that as to Baptism, <hi>It was, that they should give Christendom to Children</hi> (which it seems they had omitted) <hi>but they refused the same: and would none of his Hests,</hi> as he tells us. And, that he was not mistaken in that particular, I gave six <hi>Arguments</hi> from several <hi>Circumstances</hi> about the same, as you have in pag. 228.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr <hi>Wills</hi> answers pa. 121; opposing that of <hi>Fabian</hi> to the account that <hi>Bede</hi> gives of the story, which he repeats, giving his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from thence, why the Britains did not deny Infants Baptism.</p>
                  <p>And to which I replyed pa. 139, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> making it good from <hi>Bedes</hi> words that <hi>Fabian</hi> was right. And that they did deny Infants-Baptism; which seems plain from the following reasons, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Why <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Bedes</hi> words.</note>
                     <hi>Because</hi> Bede <hi>affirms that</hi> Austin <hi>should tell the Monks of Bangor, that they had done contrary to the custom of the Church of Rome, as well as the universal Church [then] and Apostolical Church [before]; and, amongst the rest, mentions that of Baptism to be one; and which must needs be, in their refusing to baptize children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Because as to the baptizing of the Adult, they were not contrary to the Church of Rome, the universal, and Apostolical Church; as, pag.</hi> 288.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Neither could it respect the particular mode, Rite, or ceremony, of Baptism: for the custom of the Romish Church therein, was not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, being so much opposed by the Greek and Eastern Churches, some of the Western not fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with them therein at that time; and not at all to be made out, to be Apostolical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41496:33"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It must needs therefore respect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Because the Church of Rome had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly enjoyned and imposed it, to beget Infants to Regeneration that they might be born of God, as the words of the Canon demonstrate; and which words carry the reason and ends of it: and that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the substance, and not the particular cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ordinance;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Because Infants-Baptism was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally received in this seventh age, in other parts of the World, to this end here mentioned;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Because it was received and injoined to be an Apostolical practice;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It would have been Childish and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, to have said, Baptism in general was Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical which none ever denyed, and was so fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>Austin could intend nothing else, nor Mr</hi> Bedes <hi>words import any thing else, which therefore</hi> Fabian <hi>did so fully and significantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present in saying, give Christendom to children; let them as the Church of Rome has received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd it, be born of God by Baptism, and become Christians as so generally, now received by other Churches also; and which you have been in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of. But they refused the same, which was one reason of their destruction that immediatly followed.</hi> Which was the substance of my answer to Mr <hi>Wills:</hi> only that I proved largely against him, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was not one of the Monks of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor;</hi> and that, if he had been one of that society, he had sadly declined both from their principle and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41496:34"/> practice, p. 141. As to what I said to Mr <hi>Wills</hi> upon <hi>Bede's</hi> words, Mr <hi>Bax.</hi> thus rejoyns, on his behalf, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Mr <hi>B's</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note>
                     <hi>Repeating and defending</hi> Fabians <hi>foppery, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, that it could be nothing else in which they are sayd to contradict the Apostolical Catholick Church [but Infants-Baptism].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answ. 1st. <hi>If</hi> Bede <hi>say, that</hi> Austin <hi>tells them that in many things they do contrary to the Roman Catholick and Apostolical Church; doth it follow, that the</hi> 3. <hi>things, in which he requireth their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, were all parts of those many? To preach the Gospel to the Saxons was one; is that a point that they differed from all the Apostolick Church in? when it seemeth to be from no other reason than t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>at they would not own the Saxons that had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them; nor the Papal power, that would usurp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: and on the same reasons, they might as well refuse to baptize the Saxons children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answ. To which I <hi>answer:</hi> that this about <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism</hi> doth appear to be one of the many things that they did, contrary to the <hi>Roman,</hi> as well as to the then <hi>universal</hi>-Church; appears from the grounds before given, not yet answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and which is sufficient to my purpose, though it would be good in neither of the <hi>other two.</hi> But, as to the <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Bangor</hi>'s preaching then, to the Saxons, who appear to be laymen and unordained; to be sure, they therein did contrary to the Roman and universal, however they did to the Apostolical, Church: and, for <hi>refusing</hi> the Papal <hi>ordination,</hi> without which they could not be admitted to preach with them,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41496:34"/> to the Saxons; they did as well so to do, as to refuse <hi>Christendom</hi> to children; one being as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Apostolical,</hi> as the other. Neither doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that though the Saxons had conquered them a hundred years before, that they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to preach to them, or baptize them; there being no cause for the same, upon any score of reason or truth, as Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> vainly imagines;</p>
                  <p>But, 2ly, saith he; <hi>There is no such thing in the words of</hi> Bede <hi>as (he saith) he hath shewed</hi> [but according to the manner of Rome]: <hi>and who knows not, that the Church of Rome and all in its Communion, then called the universal Church, used in Baptism the white-Garment, milk, and honey, as an Apostolical Tradition, or such as they know no original of</hi> Tertulian <hi>and</hi> Epiphanius <hi>are full witnesses of this, if there were no more.</hi> To which <hi>second answer</hi> of his, I say; that, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Chrism, and Exorcism, could not be the only thing then intended; I have before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my grounds, whereof he takes no notice; and, that the <hi>universal</hi> Church is put in distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Roman,</hi> let <hi>Bedes</hi> own words speak, <hi>viz. Nostrae consuetudini,</hi> that is, the <hi>Roman custom</hi> as Mr <hi>Wills</hi> owns; <hi>immo universalis Ecclesiae,</hi> there is the <hi>custom of the universal Church;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is well known, that the <hi>Geeek Church,</hi> in this age, did as much differ, from the <hi>Latine</hi> in those abominations, as the Monks of <hi>Bangor</hi> did from the Roman <hi>Christnings</hi> and <hi>ordination,</hi> and for which they Excommunicated one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>rebaptized</hi> each other.</p>
                  <p>What good thoughts Mr B. has of Chrism and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41496:35"/> Exorcism, those horrid execrable blasphemyes as <hi>Homius</hi> calls them; and, how fain he would perswade us, that they are Apostolical from his full witness he tells us of, we shall tell him of, and reckon with him for, hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, we shall give you some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the answer Mr B. makes to my six rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why they denyed Infants-Baptism.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">M. B's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to my 6. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. <hi>1st Reason.</hi> 1. From their so early re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Gospel, before In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism was practised.</note>The First was, because they received the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel so early in the Apostles-times; there being no such thing as Infants-Baptism to be found in the Apostles practise, nor heard of, in the Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Churches for some ages, as I proved: and for their so early receiving the Gospel, I made good from <hi>Gildas,</hi> their own Historian, <hi>viz.</hi> in the days of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> and that <hi>Tertullian, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Eusebius, Basil, Chrysostom,</hi> makes early mention of their Christianity.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>B. saith, that, they did not so early receive the Gospel, and, that it was by the Roman Souldiers, when they did; who built a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in</hi> Kent: But weakens none of my Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, <hi>He saith, that the Asia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Church had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism amongst them, in</hi> Gregories <hi>time,</hi> of which no man doubts; But what is that, to the first Centuries we speak of? wherein we hear of as little Infants-Baptism at <hi>Rome,</hi> as at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2d <hi>Reason.</hi> Because they so cleaved to the letter of the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Reason</hi> he opposeth, was this, <hi>viz.</hi> Because, it appears they so fully prized and faithfully adhered to the Scriptures, both for Doctrine, and Discipline; wherein, no such
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41496:35"/> thing is to be found, as hath been mentioned and confest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To which he saith three things; First, <hi>that I would thereby insinuate, that there is no such thing to be found in Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Which I do indeed, till some body make it appear; and which never was yet done, notwithstanding the vain-glorious boast of <hi>plain-scripture-proof, and since, More proofs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2dly, <hi>That, as much as the Ancient Britains cleaved to the Scripture; yet were there all Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes and wickedness in the Nation, as saith</hi> Gildas <hi>in his Complaint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No doubt of it: for, I quote his very words, that there was but some amongst them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the precepts of Christ intirely, whilst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them, less sincerely; and the generality, very formally, p. 332. I, respecting only the true Church amongst them, the generality of the Nation being vicious and wicked, as other Nations were; Christs flock being but a little flock.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3dly, <hi>That, by the same Argument, all that cleave to the Scripture should be against it also, both in former and latter times:</hi> No doubt, but it should be so: Especially amongst them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Tradition, and tells us, <hi>that what is practised in the Worship of God, without some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press precept, or practise in the Word to warrant it, is Will-worship and Idolatry;</hi> ought Naturally to shun such a practise as is to be made out by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as confest by themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Third was,<note place="margin">3d <hi>Reason.</hi> Because they were such ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Tradition.</note> Because they did so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41496:36"/> respect humane tradition, as the worship of God; especially all Roman Inventions, Rites, and Ceremonies: this, as before undeniably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to come from <hi>Rome's</hi> Ordination and Imposition.</p>
                  <p>To which he demands of me, <hi>Whether I will not confess, that</hi> Cyprian's <hi>Carthaginian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> Basil, <hi>and</hi> Austin, <hi>were for Infants-Baptism; were these Papists or Romans, and can I prove any Roman ordination before these?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I say, That <hi>Cyprian's</hi> letter (as is said) to <hi>Fidus,</hi> declares for it, to take away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal guilt: and, because children pray in their crying, none doubt. That <hi>Basil</hi> doth any where assert it, I am yet to learn; or, that it was judged necessary; or, it was ever ordained with impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, till Pope <hi>Innocents</hi> Canon in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Council (<hi>Austin</hi> presiding in that <hi>Council</hi>); I am yet to be informed, having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men of my side; And, if those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons were not Romish, let all men judge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, He demands of me, <hi>Whether the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were against Traditions and ceremonyes? and, Had they not Bishops, and Monks,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>To which I say, they were against traditions &amp; ceremonies especially Romish; and that serves our turn, for Infants-baptism. But, as to their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;</hi> if he mean <hi>Elders,</hi> so have we: and so had the <hi>Donatists.</hi> But that they had <hi>Prelates</hi> or <hi>Lord-Bishops,</hi> doth not yet appear. And as for the Monkery; <hi>no Romish Monks</hi> (saith <hi>Fuller</hi> in his Church-history) <hi>being Abbey-labourers, not Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey lubbers; who laboured with their own hands,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41496:36"/> and preached the Gospel;</hi> much in the way the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were in; being together in colledges, having all things in common amongst them, in imitation of the primitive times.</p>

                  <p>Concerning which, what Knights-service it may do, I leave him to improve it: But, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have fully made appear, that the Churches of the Lyonists, or poor people of <hi>Lyons</hi> or <hi>Waldenses,</hi> are already made out to us, throughout most of the Centuryes. <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> tells us of the suffering of their Churches under <hi>Antoninus Verus, anno</hi> 179. made out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by <hi>Morland, Scultetus, Beza;</hi> Confest by the Papists themselves, <hi>Rainerius, Belvedre,</hi> and <hi>Riberia,</hi> as Treat. p. 333. 340. 341. to 345.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeffery Munmouth</hi> tells us, that, as long as the British Churches possessed the Countrey, they kept themselves sound in the faith, and pure in the Worship order and discipline of Christ, as it was delivered to them from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and the Evangelists; who were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, till about 455. as <hi>Peter Heylins Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy</hi> shews. p. 310.</p>

                  <p>And further, Under this head, he tells us (as an Argument, <hi>that these Britains were not against Infants Baptism) that</hi> Pelagius, <hi>one of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, was for Infants-Baptism:</hi> concerning which I must yet referr you to what I have already said to Mr <hi>Wills,</hi> whereof Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> takes no notice.</p>

                  <p>Which when Mr <hi>B.</hi> can do in his own case, we may the better <hi>believe Smaragdus</hi> might do so also: but till then, if he did as Mr <hi>B.</hi> tells us, assert this doctrine at the same time he did <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism,</hi> we must suppose he did then as much contradict both himself and the <hi>plain evidence</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as Mr <hi>B. doth</hi> now: who somtimes tels us, that the Commission in the

                     <p>Their ancient Confessions of faith witnessing hereto, I gave you p. 239. and which did so confound Mr <hi>Wills</hi> that, till he had lopp't off what he thought good (a very disingenuous thing) he could say nothing to; but then, tells us, It was no other then what all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants held: Which theft of his I detected in my <hi>Reply.</hi> p. 110. by filling up the spaces with black lines. And then shewd him the great disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the faith of the Protestant Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, and them: notwithstanding which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (and, I think undeniable demonstration) Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> his partner, is so far from owning the fraud, and answering my 6.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41496:45"/> the truth of the thing, that he so far justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Mr <hi>Wills,</hi> as to tell us, p. 379. thus, <hi>viz.</hi> (In his reply p. 108.) <hi>He reassumeth this calumny of the</hi> Waldenses, <hi>and First, he reciteth their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to prove it, as if he wanted matter to fill up his book,</hi> &amp;c. Then mentions one or two (but answers none) proceeding to tell the world, how I face them down that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> deny'd Infants Baptism from such silly Reasons, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. <hi>And that it is not worth the labour to shew him, how the Protestants agree with the</hi> Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>in all the points where he feigneth a disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p.</hi> 112.</p>
                     <p>An excellent way to answer Arguments; as though huffing and hectoring would do it. But Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> is mistaken in the story; for he must either answer those Arguments, or confess that he cannot, which demonstrate that the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did, in these Confessions exclude Infants from baptism: and which, the better to discover Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> unfaithfulness, and for the Reader's satisfaction and conviction, I shall resume here to repeat, out of the 112, 113. p. of my <hi>Reply,</hi> because he answers them with such a slight, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Do all the Paedobaptists believe,<note place="margin">The <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Poedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists in 6 maine things in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</note>
                        <hi>that Baptism and preaching of the word are joynd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to instruct the baptized parties; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have union with Christ and partake of his benefits?</hi> Pray how is that to be made good in any infant, that has no actual knowledg, faith, or understanding?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> do they indeed believe <hi>the Lords supper to belong in Common with Baptism to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41496:46"/> of the Church?</hi> why then do not Infants par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of one as well as the other, since it belongs to them in Common, if members of the Church; as Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> saith, they are?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Do Poedobaptists with the <hi>Waldenses</hi> believe (as you say) <hi>that water in Baptism is the usual sign, representing to the subject thereof, the invisible vertue of God operating in them,</hi> viz. <hi>Renovation of the spirit, and mertification of their members?</hi> And can it be truly said, it is so to an infant, that is not capable to put forth any act of faith, Repentance, or Mortification, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any the least sign in the water, of any such things signified thereby?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Have they indeed a Harmony with the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> in what further they confess, concerning this ordinance? viz. <hi>that by it they are received into the holy Congregation of the people of God, there professing and declaring openly their faith and amendment of life?</hi> But, how is the Infant capable, with the Waldensian-Christians (not Pagan Converts), to profess and declare openly their faith and Repentance, and so to be Received into the Congregation thereby?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Do Paedobaptists indeed believe, with them, <hi>that human Traditions and Inventions are to be esteemed Anti-Christian abominations, and vain worship, and that that worship is vain and Traditional, when persons are enjoynd to it without faith, and truth?</hi> Why then are Infants Baptized by them, that have no faith or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of truth? and for which there is neither Precept or example in Gods word? and, by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41496:46"/> themselves ownd to be an unwritten Tradition?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> do they believe, <hi>That Anti-Christ, doth ground all Christianity and Religion in the Baptism of children, attributing Regeneration to that outward work done, contrary to the holy spirit?</hi> Why when do they Baptize Children, which, as acknowledged, is the basis, and foundation of the false Church, and so <hi>contrary to the spirit;</hi> and for which there is nothing but the decrees of Popes and Anti-Christian Councils, to warrant it?</p>
                     <p>Whereby you see that Infants are manifestly excluded Baptism, in these 6 particulars in these confessions; and that Paedobaptists cannot assert the same without evident contradiction to themselves.</p>
                     <p>So having proved it from their ancient confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, I gave a particular Reply to the usual Objections about their late contrary confessions, and of which there are 4. which I prove were not made till the 16. Century, and how <hi>contradictory</hi> they are, not only to the former confessions, but to themselves also in those their new confessions, from p. 309. to p. 321. Treat. And which I tell M. <hi>Wills</hi> I have done with great exactness, giving a particular account of all those confessions word for word.</p>
                     <p>To which Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> replys, thus p. 380. <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful! That such a man should talk of exactness and demonstration! stay Reader a little, and tell me whether it call not for shame and tears, that one such Book should be written by a Christian? much more that this Calumny should be thus over and over au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciously
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41496:47"/> justified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Excellently well argued! But, where is the convincing Demonstration to prove that they had any confessions for Infants-Baptism, elder then the 16.

                     <p>And so about <hi>Penanee</hi> and being Baptized <hi>in the Church by a Priest;</hi> which they read also as their belief, as is said.</p>
                     <p>After the Reading whereof, the <hi>President askt them if they would Swear to that faith that they held and believed the same; because they had so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy thought and taught before in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: to which 'tis said, Respondentes dixerunt, Quod nullo modo jurarent.

                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:41496:49"/>
                     <p>Thereupon, the <hi>President in the name of the Council, told them, that they, having held such heretical opinions, ought to swear if they would testify Repentance; and that an oath ought to be, where the faith is in danger, and that Hereticks ought by oath to purge themselves, and to return to the unity of the Church and faith: and so to bind themselves thereto, as the Catholick Church holds and believes, lest the weak in the Church be corrupted and some scabbed sheep infect the whole stock: And that neither was it contrary to the Gospel to swear. That the Angel swore; the Apostles often swore; and that an Oath amongst men was an end of strife,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To which, the whole Council consented; Notwithstanding which, they refused to swear: thereupon, they adjudged them Hereticks, man by man, taking them out of the hands of the souldiers: but what became of them,</hi> is not mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon, we finde that <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3d, the then present Pope, did, about this time in 2 or 3 several Councels, make decrees against the <hi>Albigensian-hereticks,</hi> for denying Infants-Baptism, as you have it in the Treatise. p. 250, 251, 252.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have the substance of this most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable story; and the Confession of Faith, that Mr <hi>B.</hi> boasts of, and will needs father upon the <hi>Waldenses;</hi> and lays so much stress upon it also, as to enervate all that I had sayd to the contrary; to the rendring of me an Audacious calamniator.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is manifest, that they did deny <hi>Infants-Baptism</hi> as well as the <hi>real presence</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and <hi>Pennance,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41496:57"/> wanting certain knowledg of <hi>Henry's</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and that, what he had thereof, was but by hearsay; it is a good Argument that he had certain knowledg, of what he says concerning <hi>Bruis.</hi> Though, as to <hi>Henry's</hi> Doctrine, he tells us in his 1st. Ep. <hi>ab ore ejus excepto dicebatur scriptum vidi non quinque sed plura capitula</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That is, he had seen a writing, said to be taken from his own Mouth, which holds forth not</hi> 5. <hi>but more heads (behaving reduc'd</hi> Peter's <hi>to</hi> 5. <hi>heads.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>But if <hi>Cluni</hi> had not so good knowledge of <hi>Henry's Doctrine; Bernard</hi> tells us he had: who gives us an account of 11 Articles of them. <hi>The denying of Infants-Baptism being the first, and in his</hi> 65 <hi>Sermon</hi> he saith thus of them: <hi>Haec dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata excepta esse partim per investigationem, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim parsonis altercantibus audita, partim prodita ab iis qui ad Pontificiam Ecclesiam redierunt. Which</hi> Dogmata, <hi>he saith, he obtained partly by investigation or diligent search, partly by personal disputation, and partly by some who had left them and returned to their Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that as to <hi>Peter Bruis</hi> his denying <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism,</hi> it is confirmed not only by this double testimony from thess 2 great men of this age <hi>Cluni</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the concurring <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of so many <hi>Learned</hi> men confirming the same, <hi>viz.</hi> that he not only deny'd <hi>Infants</hi> to be Baptized to save them, but they ought not to be <hi>Baptized</hi> at all. And that none ought to be Baptized by the faith of another, thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God Fathers or Parents to undertake for them to that end; nor any till they were <hi>at age,</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41496:58"/> &amp; able to make out personal faith from Christ's Commission <hi>Math.</hi> 28. And that, if any were Baptized in <hi>Infancy</hi> they were to be <hi>Baptized at age</hi> which was not to be esteemed Re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation but right Baptism: all which you have in <hi>Cluni's</hi> Epistle, which would be worth your sight at large, and which, if opportunity may permit, I shall give you in the Conclusion.</p>
                     <p>And, what a friend he was to Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, may also be found in that excellent Treatise of his <hi>concerning Anti-Christ,</hi> wherein he tells us as Treat. p. 240. and 354. <hi>That Anti-Christ grounds all Christianity and Religion in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Children, attributing Regeneration and salvation to that outward work done, so contrary to the holy spirit; And that humane Traditions are to be esteemed Anti-Christian abominations.</hi> There being nothing for Infants-Baptism as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us, the Papists and many Protestants hold but humane Tradition (though it is true, he says he is of another mind).</p>
                     <p>And that <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> were <hi>Waldenses</hi> and not wicked Manichees) as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would viley insinuate); Let their own historian <hi>Perin</hi> tell us, who giving an account of their most eminent ding men and famous <hi>Barbes</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> from their ancient Records, saith thus, Chapter 9. p. 64. <hi>De mesme pas suivit Pierre Bruis done plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers les nommerant Pierre-Brusiens auquel (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jouste-il) succeda en Doctrine un nomme Henri disquets l'on avoit esse Prestre &amp; l'autre Moine &amp; Enfeignerent es Euesches d'Arles D'Ambrum de Die de Gap ou estans chasse ils furent receus a Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze.</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:41496:58"/> viz. <hi>At the same time followed</hi> Pet. Bruis, <hi>whereupon many called them</hi> (viz. the Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) <hi>Petro-brusians. (Cluniacensis</hi> writings are <hi>Contra Petrobrusianos.) To whom there succeeded in Doctrine one</hi> Henry; <hi>the one having been a Priest, the other a Monk; and they taught in the Bishoprick of</hi> Arles, Ambrun; Die, <hi>and</hi> Gap; <hi>from whence being chased away, they were received at</hi> Tholouse.</p>
                     <p>And concerning whom <hi>Cluni:</hi> tells us in his Epistle, <hi>Fuerunt homines, non indocti neque ab omni pietate alieni,</hi> That they were men neither unlearned, nor strangers to piety, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were both learned and in their conversations ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and good men.</p>
                     <p>So that this may satisfy that they were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Waldenses,</hi> but men of so much <hi>worth and</hi> fame amongst <hi>them,</hi> that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren bore <hi>their names.</hi> And, that they were free from such <hi>wicked</hi> scandals as <hi>Bernards</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters would cast upon them as denyers of meates and mariages, <hi>&amp;c. Cluni:</hi> himself acquits them, in his 2d Ep. <hi>viz. Sacerdotes &amp; Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos ab iis compulsos ait Ʋxores ducere, carnes cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse, &amp; ipso passionis Dominicae die Paschalem do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicam praecedente, invitatis publicè ad esum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulis, comedisse,</hi> viz. <hi>That they constraynd both Priests and Monkes to marry, did boyl flesh and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good Fryday it self did feast the people.</hi> And <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus de Castro</hi> to the same purpose advers.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41496:59"/> both flesh and eggs and other prohibited things in Lent, saying, It is no sin, so to do. And as to the scandal of Manichaism and other immunities they cast upon them and their party; I shall presently unriddle and clear them off from their own pens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to their denying Infants Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they say they held as well as their Baptism, and which we are to believe in one as well as the other; it was but a pretended conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they drew upon their doctrine from their own mistaken principles, concluding from <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.5. that none were to be saved without it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> decrees of <hi>Councels,</hi> and faith of the <hi>Church;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for them to deny them <hi>Baptism</hi> either for want of personal faith, or upon the faith of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was certainly to deny them the means of salvation; so much for out men of name, <hi>viz. Beringarius, Bruis</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> who as yet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dispute, did deny Infants-Baptism; all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills being answered and removed.</p>
                     <p>And as to the famous <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> who was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council for the heresy, <hi>of denying Infants-Baptism,</hi> Church buildings, and the adoration of the Cross; and afterwards in the year 1155. hang'd and burnt at <hi>Rome,</hi> as sayth <hi>Gerhohus,</hi> as also <hi>Bernard</hi> Ep. 196 189. 195. <hi>Baron. Annalls.</hi> 1139. 1145. Num. 3. The <hi>Waldenses</hi> bearing his name for many ages, as sayth Dr <hi>Ʋsher</hi> and <hi>Perin;</hi> Mr <hi>B.</hi> takes no notice of him.</p>
                     <p>But, before we go off from this head, we must take notice of Mr <hi>Baxter's</hi> great disingenuity.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41496:59"/> Instead of reproving, Mr <hi>Wills</hi> for his false,<note place="margin">Mr <hi>B</hi>'s great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Mr <hi>W</hi>'s. unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cluni.</hi>
                        </note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful passage about <hi>Pet. Bruis,</hi> he doth what he can to palliate and justify by his partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he gives to that my just reproof for his most notorious abuse therein.</p>
                     <p>Who told us positively, that <hi>Osiander</hi> took those 5 particulars out of <hi>Cluni</hi>'s own writings which he charged upon <hi>Pet. Bruis,</hi> viz. <hi>For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Baptism, Resurrection,</hi> the <hi>Divinity of Christ, forbiding of meats,</hi> and to <hi>have all things Common;</hi> and <hi>that, If I would give credit to</hi> Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni <hi>in one, I should believe him in the other also: but that I should rather blush to introduce such a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Calumniation from such a lying Abbot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which I detected at large, proving, 1. That <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siander says no such thing,</hi> viz. <hi>that he took those particulars out of</hi> Cluni's <hi>own writings; but that</hi> Osiander <hi>sayth, those particulars with</hi> 20 <hi>more were charged not upon</hi> Pet. Bruis <hi>but the</hi> Albigois, <hi>not by</hi> Cluni <hi>but by</hi> Sabellicus <hi>and</hi> Schedlius; <hi>and taken, not out of</hi> Cluni's <hi>writings but out of</hi> Lucil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgius, Antonius, Vincentius, &amp;c. <hi>And not in</hi> Cluni's <hi>time but in the Century after.</hi> And <hi>that what</hi> Osiander <hi>sayth,</hi> Cluni <hi>charg'd</hi> Bruis <hi>with, was of another nature, and for nothing</hi> but for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying popish Doctrines in 15. particulars.</p>
                     <p>But sayth <hi>Mr</hi> B. <hi>with his daubery</hi> 1. <hi>how doth he prove that</hi> Cluni <hi>hath no more then</hi> 15? It is enough that <hi>Osiander</hi> mentions not more, he sayth <hi>Osiander</hi> mentions these 5. from him which is false.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, sayth Mr <hi>B. Doth that prove Mr</hi> Wills knew it? Yes, because he saith that <hi>Osiander</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:41496:60"/> tells us, he took those 5 particulars out of <hi>Cluni's</hi> own writings when he must needs know that <hi>Osiander</hi> sayth, he took them elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>But 3ly, <hi>How did I know that he ever saw</hi> Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni? It is enough, that he saw <hi>Osiander</hi> whom he quotes with so much confidence, citing those 5. particulars in <hi>Osiander's</hi> own words in Latin.</p>
                     <p>And 4ly, <hi>How did I know</hi> Peter Bruis <hi>was dead long before such accusations? Did not</hi> Bernard <hi>charge some of these things?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know, this being in the 13th Century, that <hi>Osiander</hi> mentions, and that <hi>P. Bruis</hi> lived in the beginning of the 12. <hi>Cent.</hi> and therefore must be dead long before these things charg'd by <hi>Schede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> &amp;c. upon the <hi>Albigois,</hi> And, for those lying reports, <hi>Bernard</hi> mentions of the <hi>Henrici,</hi> it is nothing to this purpose: He sayth they <hi>were taken out of</hi> Cluni's <hi>writings</hi> and <hi>charged expresly upon</hi> Pet. Bruis.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let Mr B. blush that instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving such notorious forgery &amp; impiety, shall thus set his wits on the tenter, to mince, hide, and cover the same; but what will not men do that are ingaged in all ill cause to justify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein.</p>

                     <p>Some of whom he takes notice of and others he doth not, and as to what I mention from <hi>Pithaeus Masson,</hi> and <hi>Arden,</hi> he <hi>sayth, that</hi> 1st <hi>they speak only concerning their denying Baptism, and that is not Infants-baptism:</hi> 2dly, <hi>That these they speak of, are the</hi> Manichees, <hi>and what is that to the</hi> Waldenses? <hi>and that</hi> Eckbertus <hi>who speaks of some that deny'd Infants-baptism, he calls them</hi> Manichees <hi>and that</hi> Erbardus, <hi>and</hi> Ermingerdus, <hi>do not otherwise affirm any to deny it, or oppose them for it, but as they are</hi> Manichees, <hi>denying with it Marriage, Resurrection,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>To which I reply: <hi>First,</hi> as to the <hi>Exception he makes to those that testify, that some denyed

                        <note place="margin">They that deny'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism were said to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</note> I prove thus: First, because the same Authors do say as Mr. B. observes that they were called <hi>Manichees,</hi> and, that they denyd Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, is already granted to us again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as being a <hi>distinct people,</hi> as supposed, from the <hi>Waldenses;</hi> and they that denyed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism were said to <hi>deny baptism;</hi> that being the chief if not the only Baptism in those <hi>times,</hi> especially in the <hi>Church;</hi> as is said after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the <hi>Lollards</hi> Treat. p. 304. out of Mr. <hi>Fox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">That the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehees,</hi> and why?</note>And 2dly. that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Manichees who denyed Infants-Baptism, but not those other things layd to their charge <hi>viz.</hi> Marriage, Meats, Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c;</hi> is my next Task.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, because Mr. B. layes so much stress upon it, we must crave the Reader's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to be more particular about it; and the rather, because he in so many places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that the <hi>Manichees did deny it;</hi> so that if we make it good that they were <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> so called, and not another people dwelling amongst them as is supposed by some, we have another good grant from Mr. B. himself.</p>
                     <p>Therefore not to insist upon it, whether there was such a one as <hi>Manes</hi> (in the 3d. Century, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us, from whom some supposed, the name came);<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Manichees</hi> and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks all one.</note> All agree that the <hi>Manichean</hi> Heresy were no other then the <hi>Phanatick▪</hi> or the sect of the Mad men, known also by the names <hi>Cathari</hi> and <hi>Publicani.</hi> viz. <hi>Puritans</hi> and

                     <p n="1">1st. <hi>That faith is necessary to precede Baptism, without which Baptism is of no force, either to take away sin, or to save the soul; and, that none is rightly Baptized without it.</hi>

                     <p>The Twelfth Chapter answers the two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions about Infants-baptism.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>So that it is manifest, he concludes against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all three Questions: First, in abusing the Sacrament, putting more in it then
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41496:74"/> God has appoynted; secondly, in both the other, <hi>viz.</hi> That a child that dyes without Baptism may be saved, whether he miss it by the hand of an old woman or a Priest: And he may be saved, if God please to give him Baptismal grace, if he be baptized either by a Priest or an Old woman and so it may be with those that are baptized in Martyrdom, which is only by way of supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any certain conclusion; and that they are foolish and presumptuous, that possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determine such secrets of God either as to damnation or salvation. And for which he is censured by <hi>Widifordus,</hi> the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> and <hi>Walden,</hi> for putting the presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fool upon the Church, both in their Fathers and Councils, who so positively determined, that the baptized child had his sins forgotten, and soul saved, and that the child that dyed without it, was certainly damned, and must not therefore have Christian burial.</p>
                     <p>But what doth he say to the main Objection, from <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born again of water and the spirit, he canot enter into the kingdom of heaven?</hi> Is not water, there, to be understood material water? and so, consiquently, baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal water, and therefore none to be saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, as the Church has determined?</p>

                           <hi>John.</hi> 3.5. Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>To this he fully answers, that if you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of material water, it was only the water out of Christs-side; but that, he takes it, to hold out the effect of Christ's death, which came out with the blood, and be regenerated by, which we must believe with the help also of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41496:74"/> spirit of Christ, which must manage that work in the soul, though it mistically holds out Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism also.</p>
                     <p>His words are these: <hi>And further, as to the faith of that Scripture</hi> Jo. 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of water</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That probably Christ might speak of the water which flowed out of his side, and third-Baptism, because it appears tbat a man martyred for Christ, although not Baptized in water, may be saved. Therefore it seems probable to understand Christ in the negative sense, that no man can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, except he is Baptized with water flowing out of his side, and with the third-Baptism: seeing that, the Trinity cannot save those that are fallen, by bringing them to blessedness, except the</hi> 2d. <hi>and</hi> 3d. <hi>person purge them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And agreeable hereto is his saying in his <hi>Ep. serm.</hi> 6. <hi>secundum</hi> Walden, viz. <hi>If it be objected that proper Baptism is not absolutly required (viz.</hi> to save and take away sin) <hi>I confess, that the Baptism of the spirit by the merit of the flowing of the materiall water out of his side doth suffice, for as many of us as are Baptized into Christ are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his death.</hi> And so by water and spirit he means no other than the washing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renewing of the holy Ghost, <hi>viz.</hi> The application of Christs death by the spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none can be saved, nor indeed profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, as he observes, Baptized in water.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>A notorious abuse:</hi> As though <hi>Wickliffs</hi> telling us what their Church held (<hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as before) about Baptizing Children by God-fathers, and teaching them <hi>their Creed,</hi> and <hi>Pater-Noster</hi> afterwards; And the Baptizing them in case of danger of death by an <hi>Old woman</hi> or Infidel, for their salvation from <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.5; was therefore <hi>Wickliffs</hi> judgment and the <hi>Waldensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> faith and practise, which was known to be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41496:76"/> the quite contrary in both. For as to their deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Gossips</hi> or <hi>Baptizing</hi> upon the faith of others, how manifestly is that made good, not only from their old <hi>confessions</hi> which disown the bringing of any to the Sacraments without their own personall faith, renowncing that of Gossips; <hi>Rainarius</hi> tells us &amp; <hi>Cluniacensis</hi> reports of them as before. And as <hi>Walden</hi> replyes to <hi>Wickliff</hi> in these words, <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 99. <hi>Fol.</hi> 102. <hi>Qui crediderit &amp; Baptizatus fuerit, salvus erit, qui verò non cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderit, condemnabitur: Quid dicis ad haec? Iste parvulus tuus, nec per se, per alios baptismaliter cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: quomodo non condemnabitur? He that believes and is baptized shall be saved but he that believes not shall be condemned: what sayst thou to this? This thy child neither by himself nor by others, Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally believes; how then shall he escape damnation?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Wickliff</hi> himself did deny them to be baptized to take away sin and save them, is fully granted us by Mr <hi>B.</hi> again and again: so that this must needs be a slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous imputation.</p>

                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:41496:76"/> in the foregoing Question, sayth, that <hi>Christ hates sensible signes, and that he placed the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of salvation in Baptism,</hi> that therefore the one and the other was <hi>Wickliffs</hi> judgment and the <hi>Waldensian</hi> faith. The Question was only, whether a child, intended to be baptized in the best way most as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Christs Rule, viz.</hi> in the Church by a Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and dyed, before it could be <hi>effected,</hi> was damned, as <hi>Austin</hi> and the Councils had determined: Therefore, that, such baptizing of Infants was according to <hi>Christs Rule,</hi> as little appears to be <hi>Wickliffs</hi> judgment, as that over any thing such thing was made appear to be Christs Rule by any word of Christ or practise of the primitive saints, either by <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant.</hi> We know what the Papists and most Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants (as Mr <hi>B.</hi> has informed us) take to be a <hi>Rule</hi> from Christ in the <hi>case. viz.</hi> Tradition▪ and the Churches direction, But that was no Rule to the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> nor to <hi>Wickliff</hi> or his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who so much impugned <hi>humane Traditions</hi> and all their popish <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>decrees;</hi> esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to be a Rule <hi>of</hi> Christs in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship but some express words of Christ to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it.</p>
                     <p>But doth not <hi>Wickliff</hi> tell us in express words,<note place="margin">3. That Children Baptized in water are Babti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the spirit: Reply'd to.</note>
                        <hi>That when Infants are rightly Baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they hold, They are baptized, with the third Baptism, having Baptismal grace?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, Mr <hi>B.</hi> with great confidence again and again tells us so: but how injuriously, let all men judge.</p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:41496:77"/>
                     <p>For first, <hi>Wickliff</hi> sayth no such words: they are not, <hi>cum habeant</hi> or <hi>habentes,</hi> seeing <hi>they have,</hi> or <hi>having,</hi> as Mr <hi>B.</hi> renders them in two places, but <hi>cum habent, when they have.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Wickliff</hi> intends no such thing, but the quite contrary to what he would make him say by such a miserable inverting of his <hi>sense:</hi> he doth not say or plead, that <hi>Children baptized in water</hi> have therefore <hi>Baptismal grace,</hi> and the third Baptism, and consequently salvation thereby, (as Mr <hi>B.</hi> would make him affirm): For, that was the very thing the Papists affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and he opposed, contradicting the sense of <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.5. whereon they founded such a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and in express terms telling us that the <hi>one</hi> maybe without the <hi>other,</hi> and that there is no <hi>jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,</hi> we have the <hi>one</hi> by the <hi>other;</hi> and that it is <hi>presumption</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> and to speak like a <hi>Pye</hi> for any so to affirm: All that he sayth, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, in those words, was only this, <hi>That God can save, if he please a child baptized in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test way they could prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>And, as a further confirmation that <hi>Wickliff</hi> intended nothing less then what Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> would make him <hi>speak</hi> herein; take <hi>Tho.

                     <p>But <hi>Wickliff</hi> (saith Mr. B.) doth say in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words,<note place="margin">4. Baptism puts away sin.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>For, this is a principle in this belief, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is rightly Baptized, Baptism blotteth-out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sin it findeth in the man to be Baptized</hi> (viz. whoever is rightly Baptized with the spirit which washeth away Original and actual sin, <hi>that Baptism</hi> (viz. the spirit Baptism) <hi>blotteth out whatever sin it findeth in the man that is to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in water:</hi> But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would make him say (in confirmation of his former mistake) <hi>whoever is rightly Baptized in water, that Baptism puts

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A great falshood.</note>Notoriously false again: All that he saith or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth in the Case, is this, that God can, if he will, <hi>save such a child</hi> which an old-woman or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell Baptizeth, as he can save the Child that dyes before they baptize it. But, must it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be his judgment, that they are good admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrators of Baptism to Children? is not this strange Reasonings?</p>
                     <p>Doth not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself tell us again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, at another time, that <hi>Wickliff</hi> was against <hi>Baptizing Children</hi> to save them, as he grants the <hi>Beringarians</hi> and <hi>Waldenses</hi> were and must be now again and again be made to be of another <hi>minde?</hi> For, wherefore was this kind of old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Infidells Baptism introduced, but to save the <hi>dying Child,</hi> as the <hi>Canons enjoyn'd?</hi> and which was so doubtful amongst themselves, that they Baptized it again, if the Child lived?

                     <p>Mr. B. further tells us, in opposition to what I affirmed <hi>Wickliff</hi> held, <hi>viz. that persons ought to be Baptized with the insensible Baptism (viz.</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:41496:78"/> have faith and Repentance or Regeneration) <hi>before they are Baptized in water:</hi> that <hi>Wickliff</hi> held the quite contrary, <hi>viz. that the two former Baptisms of Water and Blood, are but Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent signs to the third Baptism of the spirit:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, <hi>see how this man is to be believed;</hi> Wickliff <hi>calling Water-Baptism an Antecedent sign contrary to most Protestant writers that hold children are in a stae of Salvation before they are Baptized.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But whether this dealing is not like the rest,<note place="margin">Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously false.</note> judge ye: For by this Argument, that he would make <hi>Wickliff</hi> to say, Water-Baptism was to precede the spirit-Baptism, he makes him say, that blood-Baptism must precede it too, for that is one of the <hi>Baptismi priores, &amp; signa an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedentia;</hi> by which we must understand, that <hi>Wickliff</hi> thought, that none could be saved, or have their sins pardoned, but those that not only are <hi>Baptized in water,</hi> but those that are <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in blood</hi> also? for by the same <hi>Rule,</hi> that one is to precede <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the other is so also; Therefore that cannot be <hi>Wickliff's</hi> meaning in the words, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would so unfairly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon him.</p>
                     <p>But all that <hi>Wickliff</hi> seems to speak in them, in this; <hi>That the insensible Baptism is the only neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Baptism, upon which remission of sins and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation depends;</hi> and that the other two, <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> are only the <hi>sensible outward, visible signes</hi> of that <hi>inward, insensible</hi> &amp; <hi>invisible grace,</hi> viz. goes before as to <hi>sense, shew,</hi> and <hi>appearance,</hi> but ought to follow in <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>truth:</hi> and so he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41496:79"/> doth express himself, that by the spirit-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>sin is to be blotted out in him that is to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in water, viz.</hi> that he that is to be Baptized in <hi>Water,</hi> ought to have some <hi>assurance</hi> of the remission of his <hi>sins</hi> by the blood of Christ, in the first place. And therefore <hi>Fuller</hi> so well collects that passage out of <hi>Waldens</hi> 98 <hi>chapter,</hi> as one of <hi>Wickliff's</hi> positions, <hi>viz. That Baptism doth not confer, but only signifies grace given before. Fuller Eccl. Hist.</hi> 14. <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. B. p. 133. And which is indeed the Nature of all <hi>Wickliff's</hi> reasonings, and the Scripture-Authorities and instances gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>viz. That Sacraments are not to precede or to work or give grace, but to confirm, establish and signe it out: And, that without grace before wrought, Sacraments avail not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We might go through the rest of the Popish <hi>Tenets</hi> he fathers upon him; but they being not to the point of <hi>Baptism,</hi> we will leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge of them, by these we have exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to that head. And is it not a thing to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that so great a man as <hi>Wickliff</hi> was, whose fellow was not to be found from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles days to his time, should have so much dirt and filth cast upon him, and rendred so <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Anti-Christian,</hi> whenas he was raised so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently by God to be so great a scourge &amp; maul to that Interest?</p>
                     <p>It is true: I find in Mr. <hi>Iame's</hi> his <hi>Apologie</hi> for <hi>Jo. Wickliff,</hi> that in some of his first <hi>writings</hi> he spoke not so soundly concerning <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and some other <hi>Popish Doctrines;</hi> as also concerning absolute necessity, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> charges upon
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41496:79"/> him. But Mr. <hi>James</hi> observes, that his after-writings speak otherwise, and that the Elder he grew, the more he <hi>loathed</hi> and <hi>detested</hi> their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable heresies. He tells us concerning Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: in his book <hi>De ver. Script. p.</hi> 267. he hath this expression, <hi>Omnia dicta de Purgatorio, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur solummodo comminatione tanquam pia men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacia; that all the sayings of Purgatory were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by way of Commination, as it were so many Religious lies:</hi> And concerning Decrees and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity, He telleth us in the same book, p. 383. <hi>Deus nemini promittit poenam vel praemium, nisi sub conditione, tacitâ vel expressâ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that God's promises and threatnings are conditional: And that as God hath appoynted the end, so he hath appointed the means of our salvation,</hi> In <hi>Expos. Decal. p.</hi> 81.</p>
                     <p>And notwithstanding his charging of <hi>Wickliff</hi> here, yet how doth he vindicate <hi>Wickliff</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in his plea with the Jesuite: <hi>H.T.</hi> in his <hi>Key for Cath. p.</hi> 132. <hi>Name not the</hi> Wickliffians (saith the Jesuite) <hi>for they held that all things came to pass by fatall necessity;</hi> To which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, <hi>We know by many of</hi> Wickliffs <hi>own books printed, and Manuscripts, what his judgment was, whatever your Council of Constance accuse him of. It was a Divine Necessity opposed to uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and to the determination of an unruled will, that he mentioneth,</hi> and yet hath he now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to bring the Jesuites charge against him, having so fully acquitted him hereof; therefore he must not forget, who had need of a good Memory.</p>

                  <hi>that he would not do so unlawful a thing as to belie himself in what he hath to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</hi> 5ly, then proceeds, viz. <hi>That about</hi> ann. 47. <hi>or</hi> 48. <hi>when Anabaptistry began suddenly to be

(<hi>viz.</hi> for two years space) <hi>he did then write against both sorts:</hi> viz. <hi>those that baptized naked, and those that did not; which neither Mr</hi> Tombs, <hi>nor any body else, from that time to this, have ever denyed, till this Man: appealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Impartial Reason, whether he that writes</hi> 25. <hi>or</hi> 26. <hi>years after, be fitter to be believed in a matter of fact, than Common consent at the present time. And, whether it be lawfull for him to take all sorts then living for Lyars, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than this one man, that hath writen us such a Book,</hi> 25. <hi>years after, and who, in a Negative cannot be a competent witness: But if he say, that I writt that of all the Anabaptists, or of most, he would but deceive Men, it being nothing so; It is true, he confesseth, he did not see them Baptize Naked, neither can he prove that there are forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, Adulterers, Thieves, and Murderers, in the Nation; yet he presumes, he must be justified in preaching against, and calling to Repentance, the one as well as the other, without Slaunder:</hi> (Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, he had as good ground by common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and fame for the one, as the other, though he saw neither) and that, <hi>though now they may be ashamed of the thing, not continuing to do the same: So was the</hi> Donatists <hi>as to their self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;

               <p>So that the substance of what he saith in the proof of the matter of fact, that Anabaptists did Baptize Naked, as, <hi>common fame and consent,</hi> and that the truth thereof was neither <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> before he wrote the <hi>Book,</hi> nor ever since, Either by themselves, or any other, till my Book five or six and twenty years after; Resting yet confident of the verity thereof, and of his due call in detecting and reproving the wickedness.

               <p>Ans. <hi>Not, without sufficient Evidence, and sufficient call: you may not belye the Devil, nor wrong the worst man that is, though under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of doing good; God needeth not malice, nor calumnies, nor Injustice to his glory. It is an ill cause that cannot be maintained without such means as that: And when the matter is true, you must have a call to speak it, and you must speak it justly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unrighteous aggravations or hiding the better part, which should make the Case or person truly understood: But yet I must say, a great deal of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany and slaunder is committed upon this plausible pretence, and that there is scarce a more Common Cloak for the most in humane lyes and Calumnies.</hi>

               <p>How farr Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath sinned against the Lord in violating these known <hi>Rules</hi> given us, and his own declared judgment in the Case (so soundly and Excellently drawn from the Word of God and Common Equity) so unwnrranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to take up a false <hi>scandalous report,</hi> upon <hi>Common fame</hi> without competent Witnesses and enquiring of the accused, and yet to stand so in the justification thereof, is recommended to his conscience and the judicious Reader: But in the next place if we examine his Treatise that first published this calumny, we shall there finde him <hi>say more,</hi> declaring some other grounds which now he minceth, &amp; would fain extenuate, and which proves but a further aggravation of the crime: he having told us in his 12. <hi>Chapter p.</hi> 134 <hi>of Plain Scripture,</hi> what a hainous sin dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the person all over in cold water was, <hi>viz. No less than a breach of the</hi> 6th. <hi>Commandment,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41496:86"/> Thou shalt not kill,</hi> concludes his Chapter thus: <hi>viz. If Murder be a sin, than dipping Ordinarily in cold water over head in</hi> England, <hi>is a sin,</hi> &amp;c. So having made us <hi>Murderers</hi> and not to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Commonwealth, he proceeds in the next Chapter to render us <hi>whoremongers</hi> and <hi>Adulterers</hi> in the managing of our selves in that Ordinance, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Good Lord! how is the practise of the truth made a Reproach unto thy people, and a division daily? for, I have heard the defaming of many, Report (say they) and we will report it, possess the Pulpit, and make the Priest believe it, and then all the Country shall ring out, and the people be soon Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolized into the faith of it. But hear, ye rude reproachers of the people that are reprovers of the ways, whereby you run a whoring from the Lord; you shall not prevaile by such slights, such plausible pretences; you shall be greatly ashamed, you shall not prosper, and unless you repent of belying the truth of God, your Everlasting confusion shall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. It is too bad, to be credulous to flying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, worse so violently to vent them, worst of all malevolently to Invent them: I dare not say, nor dare I deem Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>to be guilty of the last, but of the two first I cannot clear him; sith that I perceive he takes it for a truth, that we ordinarily Dip naked, and thereupon disputes against it, as our usuall practise: And then, not confidently only, but of a certain, relates to the whole world, that it is no bare word, nor any doubtful thing, but an experience, a known practise: If he can clear himself he hath leave to do it for me, who also sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41496:88"/> him in the name of Christ Jesus, whose true Disciples he hath done such despite to, (the Lord keep him from dispiting the spirit of Grace, the people of whose love are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his wrath) to prove it our practise, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to dip naked, yea to produce but one instance of any women or maids that ever he saw dipt naked in all his days, &amp; I will abate him much of that I now accuse him of, in the Court of my Conscience. But if he say, as indeed he does in effect, that he never saw any dipt at all, whilst</hi> (p. 134.) he sayes, <hi>that all that ever he saw baptized, had water pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on them: how can he say</hi> Expertus loquor, <hi>it is his experience,</hi> he having <hi>never so much as seen such a thing unless it were upon the Brazen-fac't front of</hi> Featley's <hi>book, where he falsly, feignedly and filthily describes men and women dipping in that fashion; and there I believe he hath experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it: or if he only hath it from the mouths of such as heard it from the mouths of others that never saw it, but receive it by Tradition as well as he, and that Originally too from the mouths of some that made it (and in such a manner very likely it was first bruted; for I am perswaded there was never such a thing done in</hi> England <hi>unless by some Arch-Knave, and arrant whore in way of Mockage to the Gospel, which is rather a glory then a shame to Christ his truth) then let M.</hi> Baxter <hi>hear the blame of his blinde blaspheming the people of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or, if he know indeed that such a thing as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing maids and wome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41496:88"/> to make some proof of it, and to print the names of such men as have done it and such Maids and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have suffred themselves to be dippt naked, and the names of such Credible Eye-witnesses as will testify it as in the sight of God, which if he can (though I shall not give place to him thereupon, so as to be satisfied thereby for his over-lasting in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting it to be our practice to dipp naked, or for Condemning and denominating a whole party, much more their cause by the defects and abuses of some persons whom the cause disclayms; for then there were Twelve Devils because one among the Twelve, and then what an Augaean stable is your Church of</hi> England, <hi>by many members of which, Notorious Roguery is committed every hour?) yet I shall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him so farr as to undertake, that the Church or Churches where such are, shall declare every such person as hath wrought such abomination, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable without solemn Repentance for that sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did practice, or be themselves Incommunicable by all other Churches. But I believe he cannot do it. And if he cannot prove it to be our Ordinary known practise to dipp naked, That in the name of the Lord Jesus before whom he and I shall shortly both appear I entreat him, who as concerning zeal yet persecutes the Church of God, and powrs out Reproach upon them, that of an ignorant</hi> Saul <hi>he would become a searching, a seeing, a preaching</hi> Paul, <hi>of the faith which he hitherto destroys,</hi> &amp;c. So now let all the world judge whether here was not one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides my self within this 25. years deny'd and contradicted this malicious calumny and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I finde also that in the year 1653. that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>For you will find Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> in his <hi>Praecursor,</hi> (written <hi>An.</hi> 1651. the next year or the same year after Mr <hi>B's.</hi>) taking notice of the hainous charge of Murder and Adultery (in breach of the 6. and 7.

               </p>
               <p>And further as to the <hi>danger of Murder</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, he sayth; It is <hi>refuted by frequent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of aged weak persons, men and women, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in cold stormy times, in the open air, in cold running water, without detriment to their health;</hi> Concluding, <hi>That he cannot therefore be of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the ordinary practise of baptizing, by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the whole body in cold water openly or private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is either a breach of the</hi> 6. <hi>or</hi> 7. <hi>Command, unless he condemn Christ and his Apostles as appoynting and practising a rite contrary to Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as to his satyrical, he had almost said</hi> (as well he might) <hi>scurrilous quibs, he would let them pass.</hi> And in p. 26. reckons <hi>that of baptizing maids naked among his prophane bitter passages, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring more of a heathen Satyrist then a Christian preachers zealous spirit.</hi> So that here we have a witness against him <hi>an.</hi> 51. by M. <hi>Tombes.</hi> 52. by <hi>Sam.

                  <hi>The cause of their love to Episcopacy is because it was a shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, if not a shelter, to the prophane, and did not trouble them with Discipline, and because they troubled and kept under the Puritans, whom they hated; and by not exercising discipline amongst them, your Churches would become the sink of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches about you, to receive the filth they all cast out, and so became so great a reproach to Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, that would make it vile in the eyes of all sober men; so that a Prelatical Church would in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon account be near-a-kin to an Ale-house or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, to say no more. So that, for my part, were I your enemy, I would wish you a Toleration; but being truly a friend to the Church and you, I shall make a better motion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>And these are some few instances; which may, I think, prove that Mr <hi>B.</hi> hath writ against the Episcopal way to the purpose; which he affirms doth destroy government and the ends thereof; gratifyes the Devil and wicked men; <hi>destroys</hi> piety and discipline; a shelter and harbour to

               <p>Mr <hi>Bazter</hi> was for Archbishops as well as they; only would have the power of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan put into the Parish, and so have a Bishop

And though he own'd himself at a great distance from those he calls the new Episcopal Clergy because they so much fell in with the <hi>Grotian</hi> designe to introduce Popery and Libertinism, yet he had a reverend regard to the old Episcopal Divines.

               </p>
               <p>In P. 11. of the Exceptions, It is said, <hi>We have in obedience to his Majesties Commission made enquiry but cannot finde any Records of known cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, concerning any intire forms of Liturgies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the first</hi> 300. <hi>years,</hi>

                  <hi>which are confest to be as the most primitive, so the purest ages of the Church; nor any imposition of Liturgies upon any National Church, for some hundred years after. We find some Liturgy call forms fathered upon S.</hi> Basil, <hi>S.</hi> Chrysostome, <hi>and S.</hi> Ambrose: <hi>but we have not seen any Copyes of them, but such as give us suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evidence, to conclude them either wholy spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or so interpolated that we cannot make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what in them hath any Primitive Authority.</hi>

                  <hi>But so it was not,</hi> Ergo <hi>no such Liturgy was indited by them for the Churches; the Holy Scripture is silent in these matters; It is apparent, therefore, that the Churches then had no Lyturgie, but took liberty of Extemporate expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and spoke in the things of God, as men do in other matters, with a natural plainness and serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, suiting their expressions to the subjects and occasions.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And though Divisions began to disturb their peace and holy orders; the Apostle, instead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing them a form of Divine Service, for their unity and concord; does exhort them, to use their gifts and liberties aright, and speak the same thing for matter, avoiding disagreements, though they used not the same words.</hi>

               <p>But Christ having taught us other doctrine, it is better to hear him then Mr <hi>B.</hi> For he tells us; that <hi>a little leaven doth leaven the whole lump,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.

               </p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Blasphemy</hi> of that later assertion, Mr <hi>Bagshaw</hi> did well correct him for it, and to which he gave him little or no return. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our learned Casuist, by the vertue of quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, gives us a notable lift at another pinch, to help us to save our bacon; telling us, That <hi>we may own our Parishioners as Christians,</hi> that <hi>of Diocesan and Parish-relation, being accidental,</hi> the other <hi>the essentials of Communion, they being of the Ʋniversal Church.</hi> 2 <hi>Admon.</hi> p. 91. But doth the Kings Law or Bishops tell us so? and doth the Scripture give us any such allowance?</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:41496:104"/>
               <p>And with this Jesuitical distinction, mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, &amp; equivocation, What Popish Church especially in <hi>France</hi> may we not hold Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with? He being pleased, in his <hi>Grotian Relig.</hi> p. 10. as Bishop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> p. 35. in his answer observes, to tell us, That <hi>Cassander Thaule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ferus, are blessed souls with Christ, &amp; that he esteems the French Nation to be not only not an erroneous, but an honourable part of the Church of Christ;</hi> and therefore saith the Bishop, <hi>I know no man who honours the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>more than himself.</hi>

                  <p>That truth and sence were both with me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is easily demonstrated to those that have not quit both; for, doth not he know that in his seeming to take up the Crosse with them, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their advocate under those costly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> being first silenced as he tells us, preaching in private holes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,

                  </p>
                  <p>To which I answer (and to the last first):<note place="margin">Tradition and An i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by me not for probation but illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</note> I say; I mention not Tradition of any <hi>humane-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> to prove Adult Baptism of which there is no need, being so undeniably done by <hi>Scripture-Authority,</hi> upon which we only lay weight for <hi>probation;</hi> which I have again and again told you in the treatise. But because there hath been so much <hi>stresse</hi> laid upon it by the <hi>Paedobaptists,</hi> I have endeavoured out of their own Books, and from <hi>the very Authorities</hi> themselves have urged, proved the <hi>contrary</hi> to what they have affirmed; and, which is <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> and good against themselves, making it good from their own Prophets, that Adult Baptism by humane <hi>Authority</hi> is confirmed in every age) and that there is no good Authority out of primitive anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity for Infants-Baptism. But withall we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41496:110"/> that it is only Scripture-evidence, not Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that can authorize any ordinance of Christ. Therefore Mr <hi>B.</hi> mistakes himself in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I do renounce and scorne it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value my own work; which by no means I do, because I say, as a testimony of his instability, that he is sometimes for, and sometimes against Tradition, and do illustrate the truth of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and detect the error of Infants-Baptism thereby; which yet stands firm and good for the end I brought it, as much as if I should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to convince a Turk of his mistake out of his own Alcoran and a Jew out of their Talmud, and yet believe neither to be of much force, for the confirmation of a scripture-verity to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
                  <p>But in the next place, as to the first; I doubt not to make it good against Mr <hi>B.</hi> from his own words, <hi>viz.</hi> That he has affirmed the same Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he has before denyed, and for which I might give him several Instances, but shall crave leave to do it, especially from one of a latter date it being freshest in memory, and of greatest remark; <hi>viz.</hi> That about his asserting the Creed to be writ by the Apostles 12 years before any book of the new Testament was writ advancing thereby Tradition above the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and denying its sufficiency so much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to what himself had formerly written.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the first place I shall shew you how Mr <hi>B.</hi> hath opposed Tradition in general as held by the papist and what in particular, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the Tradition about the Creed as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41496:110"/> also: And then what in opposition to both he hath also affirmed.</p>
                  <p>First, as to his opposing of Tradition,<note place="margin">M.<hi>B.</hi> a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser of Tradition.</note> reade his <hi>Saints Rest,</hi> p. 235. where he tells us, That <hi>the Papists sinfully plead Tradition against the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of scripture. And in his</hi> Key for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, p. 93. <hi>That it is in our eyes an abominable impiety for you to equal your Traditions with the holy Scripture till you have enumerated and proved them; And it makes us the more to suspect your Traditions, when we perceive that they or their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons have such an Enmity to the holy Scripture, that they cannot be rightly defended, without casting some reproach upon the Scripture: But this we do not much wonder at, for it is no new thing with the applauders of Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And again in his</hi> Right Method, <hi>p.</hi> 205. <hi>That it was the Devil that opened a gap for humane ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> [or Traditions] <hi>at which he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bring in more at his pleasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in his <hi>Key for Catholicks</hi> p. 454. <hi>Scripture</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is the Test of Christianity, and must shew us sound in the faith; though the Church may shew us peaceable; therefore to seek for unity, verity, or felicity, by the loss or distruction of sanctity, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or charity, is really to renounce, oppose and lose them,</hi> viz. Sanctity, Religion, Charity.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly,<note place="margin">M.<hi>B.</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the Tradition about the Creed.</note> as to the Tradition about the Creed, being writ by the Apostles themselves, and of the dangerous consequence of such a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, take what largely he hath sayd in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one Mr <hi>Ashwel,</hi> who maintained that the Creed was written by the Apostles before the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41496:111"/> Scripture, and to be received as the Scripture by the Traditions of the Fathers and Ancients with whom it was left for us, In his <hi>Appendix to his</hi> 2d <hi>Edition of the Reformed Pastor,</hi> where he tells him. <hi>That he thereby advanced</hi> the Creed above the Scripture, and with contempt spit in the face of the Scripture, <hi>Because as he tells him it cannot be proved by Scripture or Antiquity that it was writ by them but much to the contrary.</hi> And then gives these following substantial Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments why the Creed in that form of words now delivered to us, could not be written by the Apostles, before the Scripture was written.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>because there is no proof tendred thereof by the affirmers of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>because the Fathers in the first ages do give us the Creed in other words, not one of them giving us this form for above</hi> 300. <hi>years after Christ:</hi> Ignatius, Iraeneus, Origen, Tertullian, <hi>write the Churches faith, but none of them in this form; So that it would make a man shake his head</hi> (saith Mr <hi>B.) to reade such kind of proofs as Mr</hi> Ashwel <hi>offers, which only serve to disprove the thing heaping up forms to prove the Apostles used this Form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>because (saith he) I finde so many clauses new in this form,</hi> and for our better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation mentions them out of Bishop <hi>Ʋsher, viz.</hi> [maker of heaven and earth] <hi>was a new additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not in the Ancient Copies.</hi> 2dly, [conceived] <hi>is added, the old form is,</hi> born of the holy Ghost. 3dly <hi>The word</hi> [Dead] <hi>is added.</hi> 4ly [descended into hell] <hi>is added,</hi> 5ly <hi>The name of</hi> [God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty]
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41496:111"/>
                     <hi>to the Article of Christ sitting at the right hand of God.</hi> 6. [Catholick] <hi>is added to holy Church.</hi> 7. [Communion of Saints] <hi>is added.</hi> And 8. [life everlasting] <hi>is added.</hi> All which he tells Mr <hi>Ashwel, are a considerable part of so short a Form, and which additions he sayth,</hi> (as Bishop <hi>Ʋsher</hi> observes) <hi>were made not at once, but as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resyes sprung up at several times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the Nicen Creed was as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and more anciently called the Apostles Creed, and sayd to be delivered from the Apostles,</hi> (as he sayth Bish. <hi>Ʋsher</hi> tells us <hi>in his Dissert. de Symbol.</hi> p. 16.) <hi>And therefore that we owe it no more reverence as to the Apostles, than to the</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>or</hi> Nicen Creed, <hi>and that the</hi> Nicen <hi>was the more common Creed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>From the uncertainty and impossibility to know this by Tradition,</hi> that if it should be, as M. <hi>Ashwel</hi> sayth, That the truth of the Apostolical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Creed, and exposition of Scripture also, was to be made out to us by Tradition from the writings of the Church and ancient Fathers, Mr <hi>B.</hi> pathetically thus expresseth himself: <hi>Oh that I knew where to finde the Church that could give me the sense of all Gods Oracles by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Tradition as from the Apostles themselves; or that I knew the name or characters of those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had this</hi> Depositum <hi>the sense of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by Tradition from the Apostles; and where I may finde it left to us. Is it each Father individual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? or is it the greater Number together? And how shall we take their vote, and knew which of them to account a Father, and which not: surely when I
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41496:112"/> reade them telling us no more the sense of those Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and so often erring and disagreeing, I cannot believe their memories were all so good as to deliver d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wn from father to son an Exposition upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without writing: And if ever any of them had such a voluminous commentary in his brain from the hands of the Apostles, which was not thought meet to be given in writing, the issue by this time may convince us that either it was intended only for themselves, or else that indeed such a world of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would have been surely better kept then this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th kept it. For I think most of us love our fleshly ease so well that if we knew where the book or the Church were that would give us such a certain Exposition of Scripture as from the Apostles, we would be glad of it, not only to the quieting of our minds, but also for the sparing our time and labour we bestow in our study?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concluding that Mr <hi>Ashwels discourses</hi> (and many of his train) <hi>were self-conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

It was called the Apostles Creed because it was afterwards for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance taken out of their writings, not that they were the penners of it (conferring besides the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the stile and frame of words as we have them

As Christ himself was the Author of the Baptismal Creed and Covenant, so the Apostles were the Authors of that exposition which they then used, and taught the Church to use; And they did that by the holy Ghost as much as their inditing of the Scripture</hi> (which is nothing else, as he affirms, <hi>but the explication of the</hi> 3. <hi>Baptismal Articles;) and to be the summary and symbol of Christian belief;</hi> 12. <hi>years before we had any book of the New-Testament, and above</hi> 66. <hi>years before we had them all: And this of Gods own making which was ever agreed on;</hi> when though he truly before tells you (and which also is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Magdeburg.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41496:113"/> most</hi> 66. <hi>before the whole). And it is certain by Church-history that (though some variety of little words was used, yet) this same Creed for substance (except the</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3. <hi>clauses mentioned by</hi> Usner <hi>and</hi> Vossius) <hi>was commonly used at Baptism from the days of the Apostles. And it is certain, that if the Apostles did take this course so many years before they wrote any of the New-Testament, they did this (as well as that) by the holy Ghost: and so that the holy-Ghost seconding Christs own Baptismal Law, or Instituted test, did make the Creed to be the summary of the Christian belief, twelve-years before we had any Book of the New-Testament, and about</hi> 66. <hi>as is said before we had them all: And then it will appear what is Gods appoynted Test of Christianity, Communion, and Special love.</hi>

                  <p>And in p. 287. <hi>Giving an account what sins</hi> (in his apprehension) <hi>some Protestants have run into in their opposition to Popery,</hi> tells us in the 2d. place, that <hi>they have wronged the Church by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing the Tradition of the Creed and the Essentialls of Christianity, by many means besides the Scriptures.</hi> Then goes on in his Preface, <hi>all which considered, though I think it is the truth which I long ago wrote against a Treatise of a learned man (Mr.</hi> Ashwell) <hi>in the</hi> Appendix to the 2d.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41496:114"/> how notoriously Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath contradicted himself herein: And whether by that advancing this peice of Tradition before and above the Scripture, he doth not (in his own words to Mr. <hi>Ashwell</hi>) with contempt spit in the face of the Scripture as so substantially confirmed by those 5 Arguments he gave in the case, and which he now tells you he thinks was the truth; yet again seeming to quit so much Reason of his own and others, and to fall in with so much of what he so severely judged to be the raw, dry, self-conceited notions of some ignorant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochers, and, as he was pleased to call them, pot-companions, meaning as I suppose Mr. <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> for one, against whom he writ, and whom nevertheless he now owns to be a learned man; let who that can, reconcile such contradictions.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, is it not manifest, that what he affirms as to the precise time of its Fabrication, <hi>viz.</hi> 12. years before any book of the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was written, if we may give credit to that which goes for authentick story, is fabulous and ridiculous: For <hi>Paraeus, Proaem. in Math.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41496:114"/> informeth, and learned men, both amongst Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and Papists, agree: And the Creed as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> now tells us was written 12. years before any Book of the New-Testament was written, then it must be at least 3. or 4. years before Christ dyed: If so, how will it corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond with that part of it <hi>viz. suffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>was Crucified, dead and buryed, he descended into Hell, the third day he rose again from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore is it not meet, that he help us in this difficulty also, and give us something besides his own word to prove this Tradition, as well as the precise time mentioned by him; and how this seeming contradiction is to be reconciled, since we are to receive it with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Authority, if not greater than the Scripture it self. Otherwise that he will give us leave in his own words to conclude, It is abominable impiety thus to equal Traditions with the holy Scriptures, and no other than the Devils Gap, to bring in what more additions he please at pleasure.</p>

                     <hi>viz.</hi> That the difference between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist and Protestant in these great fundamental Doctrines of the Gospel are but seeming not real differences?

And withal it must not be forgotten, that Mr <hi>B.</hi> in the same Book p. 72. tells us, <hi>That the Doctrine of the Papists is not only contrary to many express texts of holy Scripture but also contrary to its self.</hi> Whereby we must understand that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Doctrine is also contrary to express Scripture and it self also; or else in his usual method he doth contradict himself, in affirming that there is no more difference betwixt them in Doctrinals; and it must be remembred, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time he is pleased to tell us, <hi>That their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God to merit heaven, and doing works of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation, are of the Devil, as you have it</hi> in his book call'd <hi>The right method, &amp;c.</hi> p. 255.

                     <note place="margin">A most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> p. 89. which saith, as Mr <hi>B.</hi> tells us, for our better information. <hi>Now we have planted that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne drugg,</hi> Arminianism, <hi>which we hope will purge the Protestants from their Heresie, and it flourisheth and beareth fruit in due season:</hi> And thereupon tells us, <hi>That the papists did creep into the Church under the garb of conformable Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is too well known.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41496:118"/> many more of them did openly revolt when the game seem'd to be spoyl'd that was played under-board, it had been far less hurt to us I think if all the rest had been as open.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if this be true Doctrine thus providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially dropt from his own pen, what shall we conceive of his now being the declared follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> and the Greek Churches in those Doctrines before-mentioned; (yea so much out-doing <hi>Arminius</hi> himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,) but that it is as he unfolds the mystery to introduce Popery. And what a mercy would it be wholly to get off his Monks hood, that under the shape of a zealous Presbyterian, he may do us no more mischief, but appear a papist in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                  <p>But Mr <hi>B.</hi> will tell you he is no Papist, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he renounces the Popes supremacy as Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Monarch, and his infallibility, for which however he is censured by the Protestants to favour them in Doctrine, yet is he much more displeasing to the Papists. <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>I know that one man is naturally uncapable of being the Monarch of the world.</hi> In his <hi>Ep.</hi> to his <hi>Full and easie fatisfaction:</hi> centuring herein his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est opposition against Popery, and by which he would not be thought to be a Papist.</p>
                  <p>But this is a covering too narrow for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knows the French whom he owns to be so honourable a part of the Church of Christ (and all the world knows to be Papists) do go neer as far in renouncing the Popes Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal supremacy and infallibiliiy as Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>

And 2ly <hi>p.</hi> 298. He brings the Sectary telling him, <hi>That he strives against God's judgment's, by which he hath oft-times disown'd Popery among us, and would make that less odious which God by wonders hath oft

He grants that God hath oft marvellously preserved us from their attemps, but if you will use untruths against them, they will repay you two for one, whereof he gives several instances out of their popish Legenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of lying Prodigies befalling Protestants. Insinuating as though we bear up our selves by such lying fables against their Religion, as though by a series of divine and miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, God had not preserved this Nation from their diabolical attempts for above an 100 years last past.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again <hi>p.</hi> 298. He brings in the Sectary further telling him, <hi>That it is one of the Artifices of the Papists which you have learn'd when they would draw men to set light by the purity of Religion, and the worship of God, to cry up love and concord and peace instead of it, and so to tie all mens tongues and hands from resisting their wicked Church pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the fear of Schism, or being uncharitable to the polluters, And so you will draw men to indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency in Religion on pretence of peace and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> This is to the purpose in the Consciences of all.

                     <hi>viz.

                  <p>Insinuating that our separating from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists for bloody Idolaters under pretence of keeping faith and <hi>worship</hi> pure, was a breach of <hi>mercy,</hi> and a sinning against the law of <hi>Love,</hi> and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Again p. 295. He brings the Sectary telling him this great truth, <hi>viz. That God telleth us himself, that he is Jealous about his worship, and hath in Scripture more severely executed his justice upon the corrupters of his worship, than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most any other crime.</hi> A most remarkable obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.<note place="margin">M <hi>B.</hi> seems to make false worship to consist in Idol and Image-worship only.</note> But how doth he avoid the force of it? <hi>It is true saith he, God is a jealous God no doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Idolatry, and to worship by an Image is to deny him to be God. That the Jews great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Idol trys of the Nations about them were to be oppugned by great severities of God, and no doubt but</hi> Moses <hi>Law was to be honoured by Gods severe executions on the breakers of it.</hi> But Christs preaching under the Gospel <hi>is to send men to learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. And when the woman of</hi> Samaria <hi>like our Sectaries did turn from the Doctrine of faith to the controversie of the times, Christ teacheth her to worship God in spirit and truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As though God was not as severe under the Gospel for corrupting his worship as under the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41496:120"/> Law, &amp; enjoyn'd not the keeping to institutions as well as to the Moral Law: and as though the popish abominations were not to be abandoned as Idolatrous worship that provokes the Lord, and pulls down Judgments; and as though those that conscientiously pleade separation from them upon that account deserve to be esteemed Sectaries? At another time he can tell us, <hi>That false worship doth not only as Idolatry signifie the worshiping of a false God, or the Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping of Images, but the worshiping of God by Doctrines and prayers that consist of falshoods, or devising worship-ordinances, and falsly saying, they are the ordinances of God.</hi> Defen. of Princ. of Love. p. 3. part 2.</p>

                  <p>But whether this be not a full confirmation of the Suspition of his revolt to Popery, that not only speaks now so suspitiously about the Popes being the AntiChrist concerning which he had spoken so fully in his former book: And by telling us of the darkness of that book which so fully discovers it, and to that degree so, that as he formerly confest that if he be not he, he has ill luck to be so like him.</p>
                  <p>But first, as to the instance he gives of the darkness of the <hi>Revelations</hi> in discovering of these things from the different judgments of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors, I presume will be found to be his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, for however there may be great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences about the Mistical Numbers, the time of opening the seals, and powring out the Vialls, yet there are few of the Protestant Expositors, I think, I may say, not 4 in 5 but do agree, that the Pope is the Anti-Christ, the man of sin, the head of the false Church, or that Bloody-scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-Whore that corrups the Earth with the cup of her fornications, in whom is found the blood of the Saints, and the Martyrs of Jesus: And from whose filthy Church or state Gods people are commanded <hi>to separate, and not to partake of her sins, lest they share of her plagues.</hi> He confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing ss before that Dr. <hi>Moors,</hi> Dr. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

The first thing I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned from him was this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing a child with chrysm justified</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is true: I own my self one of those silly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries that holds it sinful and unlawful for a Protestant Paedobaptist so to baptize his childe for the following reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, because Mr <hi>Hanmer</hi> in his <hi>Confirmation</hi> a book so much recommended by Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> doth upon such good grounds tell us, that Chrysme, and Exorcisme, are as <hi>Homius</hi> tells
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41496:126"/> us so blasphemous and iddatrous; and <hi>such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of Antichrist</hi> as <hi>Tilenus: such empty and impious ceremonies</hi> as <hi>Ames;</hi> and such <hi>execrable blasphemies,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> informeth us: Yea Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> himself besides this, tells us in his <hi>Right method,</hi> however he has so forgot himself, <hi>p.</hi> 255. That <hi>Chrysme,</hi> viz. <hi>Crossing with Oyle, salt, spittle, and exorcisme, or conjuring out the devil, (as he tells us) were the additions that the devil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and put into Gods worship;</hi> Therefore it being such a blasphemous, idolatrous, filthy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable and devilish thing, it will be some vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to those that shall presume to call it sinful, whatever our great dictator saith now to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Scripture is positive, that we must not <hi>do evil that good may come thereon,</hi> but rather avoid the supposed good than to contract so great a guilt: For what popish Idolatrous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination may we not do upon this pretence? May we not go to their Sacrament of the Altar rather than want the communion, and thereby partake of all the blasphemies of their Mass, which we may confidently affirm is not less cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted than this of Baptism? Doth not this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Mr <hi>B.</hi> reprove the folly of the old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that would rather die than put a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense into the Censer, or so much as give the least consent that another should do it for them, and how simple were so many in Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> time to go to the fire when they might have saved their skins with such compliances as these? And how doth it reprove those <hi>Waldenses.</hi> which as Mr <hi>B.</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:41496:127"/> tells us of, from <hi>Perin,</hi> that <hi>rather than have their Children baptized by their popish priests with their blasphemous additions, they refused to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them for some hundreds of years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I judg it utterly sinful and unlawful to commit such abomination,, for by the same reason we give way to own sinful addition in Gods worship, according to Mr <hi>B's</hi> wholesome rule before given us, we may introduce what the Devil shall make for us. And which to save our selves the labour and our Reader the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may serve for an answer to all the rest of the Popish additions, and inventions that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ has injoyn'd, and Mr <hi>B's</hi> Logick would hook us into conformity to, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>popish Cring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Kneelings, Bowings, Homilies, Vowes, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripha, Crucifixes, Images, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And therefore if he please, let him tell the world as he desires, that I am one of those that judgeth it sinful to admit any of these things in Gods worship, without a rule and direction from himself, bespeaking our selves wise above what is written, and as Mr <hi>B.</hi> himself hath so well informed us already, as <hi>p.</hi> 32. will serve only <hi>to render Gods divine worship a humane thing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare us exceeding proud in thinking our selves wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than our maker and Redeemer in exalting our selves above him, by correcting his Laws and mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his work, and contract to our selves a great deal of guilt by sinfully adding to the thing God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands contrary (as he tells us) to</hi> Deut. 12.32.</p>

                     <hi>AS to what I said in my Preface about his Quaeries of the Scripture, he seems to be much concerned, expressing himself thus,</hi> viz. But yet we have not done with the high charges of his Preface. <q rend="inline">Oh were not those <hi>20.</hi> Quaeries, <hi>in his 2d</hi> Admon. p. <hi>142.</hi> so much against the self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing Authority of the Scripture, in favour of Tradition, a hainous provocation, to say no more of them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which he saith,</hi> It seems they were so to you, but really did you reade that book and the other to Mr <hi>Bagshaw,</hi> and yet not fear to follow him and out-do him in notorious untruths, after so full a convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and warning as was given him, think of it, think on it, and again cry out; Bus alas! whereto will men run left to themselves: <hi>And then for my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information and reproof, turns those 20. Quaeries into Catagorical propositions, adding 4. more to them, now 24. in all, which he joyns to the 42. new Commandments before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, making them 56. in all: And which he tells me as he hath Jesuitically drest them, If</hi> I and his revilers own them, so will not sober men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which I think Mr.</hi> Bagshaws <hi>return to those Quaeries may be a good answer,</hi> viz. when you have satisfyed me that you sinned not greatly in raising such mists and doubts, and when you have
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41496:128"/> given me security that you will not ask any more of them, than he would then reply to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if he would heve another answer in the mean time, I'le give it him from his own pen, as he may find it in his</hi> Key for Catholicks, p. <hi>200.</hi> ch. <hi>31.</hi> Deter. <hi>22.</hi> Another of the Jesuits deceits is, by quarrelling with our Translations of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and making the people believe that we have so corrupted it, that it is none of the word of God, and so they openly scorn it and deride it.</p>
                  <p>As to this point, though learned men can soon confute them, by vindicating the Text, as in the Original Languages, and then vindicating our Translation; yet the common Disputant need not put them and himself to so much trouble, if really they will but let the Law of Goel contayn'd in the Scripture be the rule by which our difference shall be tryed and decided; we will cut short the rest of the controversy, and take it wholly together, and we will stand to the vulgar-Latine, which is it that themselves applaud; we are content that this should be the rule between us. Yea, rather than they shall shift off the unlearned by these tricks, we will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of their own translation, which the Rhemists have (with little friendship to our cause) composed, only we must entreat them that their Commentaries and conceits be not taken with the text as part of the word of God. So that this quarrell is quickly at an end, the Scripture is so full against them, that no Translation that makes it not another thing can make it to be on their side. <hi>If he would have a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Answer to his 24.

               <p>To the which I say,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Answered.</note> how far carnal fear and worldly honour and Interest might influence that change, I shall not determine; but leave the matter to him that knows the secrets of hearts, and will judge righteously: only I must upon this occasion remember Mr <hi>Allen</hi> of a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of his; in his Epistle to Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> before his <hi>Baptismal abuses</hi> (the Book we have been speaking of) treating so amply against Infants &amp; for believers Baptism: applys to him in these following words, telling him, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Nature of the subjects being such, as tends to perswade men to embrace that despised way which is generally eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where spoken against. And which is apt to bring the assertors of it into disesteem and contempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, if not to expose them to sufferings of a worse Nature, the light whereunto, necessitates either to hazard much of our outward honour, peace and prosperity in the world, in following that light, or their inward peace and tranquillity in not obeying it.</hi> And as to the time (mentioned by Mr <hi>B.</hi>) it is well known that he had but half an eye who could not see such tryals were then coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to try our sincerity of that kinde. And some have been apt to fear that Mr <hi>B.</hi> himself was not without temptations of that kinde, in writing in that year so largly not only for a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, but for so many of the most <hi>desputable</hi> Ceremonies (as Dr. <hi>P.</hi> tells him) of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to Mr <hi>A</hi>'s purgation in telling <hi>us what
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41496:133"/> peace he has had in that his alteration upon a sick bed,</hi> I say for my own part I shall not wonder that he who has stifled so much light, and cut the throat of such a <hi>witness</hi> he has so famously born for Christ against Antichrist; should be left in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to such a calm (I say not, and the Lord grant it be not a hardned) Conscience under it. And may not (doth not Mr <hi>A.</hi> think) many eminent professors who have turned <hi>Papists, Quakers, Athiests,</hi> give us in the same experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? and will not that amount to as good a Vindication as his; which is submitted to the all-seeing God, and the word that must Judge us to determine.</p>
               <p>And for a conclusion to this matter, we shall end with Mr <hi>Allens</hi> most solemn words to Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in that remarkable Epistle before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz. The day is now hastening apace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the mighty God will reckon with the Babylonish Whore for corrupting the Earth with her deceits, and then the eye of Jesus Christ will be upon those who have throughly pleaded his cause, wholly followed him, and faithfully born witness to his truth, against all hir unsound and corrupt wayes, To keep them from the hour of Temptation that shall come upon all the World to try them; whereas those that have been partakers with her in her corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must then be partakers with her in her suffrings, though otherwise they be the people of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, unless they have before that time obeyed that voyce which sayth, come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not of her plagues.</hi> And therefore upon the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41496:133"/> whole, let the Reader judge, whether I deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have such a complaint made against me for saying, these following words, the passage reflected upon hereby, in the Postscript of 1. <hi>Ed. Treat. of Baptism,</hi> viz.</p>
               <q>And which Books, (viz. <hi>Mr</hi> Allens, <hi>and Mr</hi> Lambs <hi>Treat. for believers, and against Infants-Baptism</hi>) are done with that Judgment, strength of Argument and Authority of Scripture, that notwithstanding they have both of them personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declined those truths, so zealously and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standingly pleaded for by them, and are gone back to that they therein call <hi>(or if that like not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to be)</hi> humane Tradition, will-worship and Idolatry, <hi>fulfilling Dan. 11.35.</hi> Prov. <hi>8.4.</hi> Gal. <hi>2.18. 2 Pet. 2.21.22.</hi> Yet will their books not only live as a witness for God and his reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched truth, but as a living Testimony against themselves, in their unreasonable, and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous departure from the same (without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) to all generations.</q>

               <p>THat I have according to <hi>your</hi> admonition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved some time in secret seriously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider those hainous crimes you laid to my charge, I hope the foregoing lines may be some witness for me to your own Conscience and to all good men. It has I assure you been no small triall to me to finde a man so famed for learning and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety so pressing to peace and unity as your self, so to exceed the bounds of civillity, charity, and morallity, and give way to such a <hi>Shimei</hi> and <hi>Rabsheka</hi> spirit, and how I have improved your unchristian dealing for the benifit of my <hi>soul,</hi> and to pray for such a one that so despitefully useth and persecuteth me, is best known to him that knows all things. If I have in this my return (under your <hi>highest provocations</hi>) used too much sharpness at any time, I allow not my self in it, though you know some <hi>are sharply to be reproved that they may be sound in the faith:</hi> And you are pleased to tell us, that you stand in more need of faithfull reproofs, then your friends admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to you (and I think so too, or else it would not be so bad with you as it is:) your own words are these: 1 <hi>Disp.</hi> 5. <hi>Sacram.</hi> p. 487. <hi>I confess my pride needs sharper reprehensions than friends have ever used about me; and therefore they are better from any body than from no body;</hi> And therefore saith Dr. <hi>P.</hi> p. 164. of his <hi>Append.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41496:134"/> That you had convinced him of the irrefragable Orthodoxy and truth of what you have there put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record, telling you (he did but eccho your own words) that he must cross his own inclinations and change his stile for no other end then to serve your needs: For you gave it him under your hand, both that your malady is dangerous, and that it needs a rough cure, and that you are not like</hi> Alexanders Bucephalus <hi>to be subdued with soft usage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Sir having made so good use of your Admonition, and reproofs, as to discharge my self of those Forgeries and immorallities charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, getting the beam out of my own eye; may with more freedom endeavour the getting the mote out of my Brothers eye: And you that with so much liberallity dispence your Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to others, ought also as well to take them your self when they come to your turn.</p>

            <p>TO what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath done in his <hi>Preface</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> his book, and his <hi>Christian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,</hi> in my <hi>Just Reply</hi> is answer made; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those writings there is lately published his mock-titled virulent book <hi>More Proofs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Churchmembership.</hi> The dispute at <hi>Bewdly, Jan.</hi> 1649. how insolently, injuriously, unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and unchristianly it was managed and published by him, my Antidote <hi>Praecursor,</hi> and other writings shew: Infants rights and benefits conferred by the baptismal Covenant of grace are a meer <hi>Chimaera:</hi> I challenge him to set down distinctly his <hi>theses</hi> concerning the grace he means, the covenant of grace, what and whose it is, how it is baptismal, what are the rights and benefits conferred to infants by it, using words in their proper sense and genuine notions, and then without questions, exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, flirts, suppositions unproved, set down his Scriptures, and form his arguments syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistically, as that eminently learned man menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in my Epistle before my <hi>Felo de se</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and then I doubt not but learned and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate disputants will see his folly, and finde his arguings frivolous; however superficiall Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars though godly, zealous preachers, and well affected Christians addicted to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> by reason of his preaching do esteem his opinion and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41496:140"/> about this point. That I printed Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s letters without his consent, was most just, who printed most injuriously my answers in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute at <hi>Bewdly,</hi> before I had revised them, though I sought it, and it was promised me, and had in print falsely blazed it abroad, that he had driven me to grosse absurdities in the dispute, which in his <hi>peaefestinantis morator,</hi> he passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when my <hi>Praecursor</hi> had acquitted them from absurdity: and his printing my <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions</hi> on his <hi>Aphorisms of Justification,</hi> justify my printing his letters without his consent right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they being written vpon mature considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it being by me intimated, that it was necessary I should know his meaning, when I examined his argument. But how ill he hath dealt with me may appear, 1. In his leaving out all these sections, 33. 34. 35. 49. 50. 51. 64. 65. 66. 67. 68. 69. 70. 71. 72. 73. 74. of the third part of my <hi>Review,</hi> in which that which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> brings for his pretended infants visible Church-member-ship in the Church, Christian distinct from the Jewish, and their admission into it by vertue of Gods covenant, or law of nature, or parents, proparents, or owners act of dedication, is fully examined 2. In his putting sect. 53. 54. 55. 56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. before 52. which did syllogistically prove infants no visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church-members. 3. In his leaving out many considerable passages in my answer to his letters, especially sect. 63. about his 10. caluminatory questions, imputing my answers to passion, and his reply needless, which I count necessary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:41496:140"/> to bring me to repentance or himself for his uncharitableness towards me, who have not met with a man more uncharitable in his speeches of me, and more pertinacious therein. 4. In mistaking mine and his own words; which are sometimes non-sense, and sometimes cross to himself elswhere. 5. In not giving answer to what he should, but putting it off with a scoff, and yet burdening or encumbring the dispute with many unnecessary questions, which is not answered, yet being his part to prove, he should have shewed his law and ordinance of infants vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church-menber-ship unrepealed, so as that they belonged to every Church of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its constitution, Jewish or Christian, by Gods appointment: whereas he brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but dictates, and his own perswasion, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magins the Christian Church as if it were by nature, the kingdom of Christ having infants as other kingdomes; whereas Christs Church was framed as a School by preaching, not as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by birth or cohabitation, so manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the ways of Christ, and his Apostles, and their relations: that I admire any that reads the New Testament, should not perceive the delusion with which he deceives himself and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 6. As for his answers to my arguments, sect. 52. they are so slight and insufficient, that were it not my book is so big, and in the hands of so few, and so few either preachers or others are acquainted with University exercise of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, and Logick terms, I should judge it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary to write any thing, to shew their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41496:141"/> If readers of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would compare my writings with his, and examine both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice and partiality. And I mervail that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> should be so confident of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he talks of the Covenant of God to the faithfull and their seed, which was not made with all <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. that he should imagine parents relation, consent, or dedication should make an infant a visible Christian Church-member, without any visible note either of parents or children, whereas he himself often in his writings makes the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith to be that which makes a visible Church-member; and there is no mark or sign of a visible Christian Church-member in a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers infant more then in an infidels, that he should imagine that a parents dedication should intitile to Baptism, which is only by institution, and is the only rule by which it is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, that he should call that profession which is thus made a baptismal vow of the infant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging it as his vow, that he should so continue to contradict himself as my <hi>Felo de se</hi> shews, and other writings, and yet never reconcile the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, nor recant his palpable grosse false asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of infants Church-member-ship and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, that he should upon such vain pretences of want of time, of his greater business put off the examining of this great point of Christianity as it is reckoned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. and censure others for their earnestness about it, though by solemn Covenant engaged to endeavour reformation in worship according to Gods word; I am bold to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41496:141"/> tell him that his way of yielding so much as he doth to Papists and others, that erre, his making disputes in many points but Logomachies, his motions to peace with losse of truth, are such as are likely to make more breaches, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with that sincerity, tenderness of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, love of truth, and zeal for Christ, which should be in all that are called by his name. And sith Baptism is a most solemn ordinance, equal, if not of more importance then the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to shew so much care for its right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, and so little for the other, is a signe of hypocrisy, and makes liable to Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as the irregular administration of the Lords supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. And <hi>I</hi> say, his quarrelling with me or Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> about my Edition of my <hi>Felo de se,</hi> and mention of it, as it is vain, it having been just to shew his errour, and to warn others of adhering to him in that point, so it is a signe of too much hardness of heart in him, that he doth so slightly put it off, and so pertinaciously retains and avoucheth that errour, which his own writings refute.</p>
